<h2 id="GENERAL">General</h2><div>This page provides the documentation of the universal HALCON USB3Vision interface for accessing all <a href="http://www.visiononline.org/vision-standards-details.cfm?type=11">USB3 Vision</a> compliant cameras. 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/registration">Registered</a> customers can download the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> of this interface from the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/">MVTec WWW server</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>Intel compatible PC with Windows    7 (32-bit or 64-bit) or newer, 
   also WoW64 (using 32-bit HALCON on 64-bit Windows), 
   Linux with kernel 3.5 (or higher), or OS X 10.8 (or higher). 
</li>
<li>The computer has to be equipped with a USB 3.0 interface. Make sure you 
   use the latest drivers for the USB 3.0 host controller. Note that on 
   Windows systems it is usually not sufficient to search with the built-in 
   mechanism, instead you need to check the website of the host controller 
   manufacturer for the newest version. 
</li>
<li>Ensure that the acquisition interface has full access to the connected 
   USB3 Vision devices: 

<ul>
<li><b>Windows</b>: one of the supported drivers (WinUSB, libusb-win32 or 
      libusbk) attached to the device's composite parent. 
</li>
<li><b>Linux</b>: read-write access privilege for the corresponding device file(s). 
</li>
<li><b>macOS</b>: access is provided automatically. 
</li>
<li>Further details in section 
   <a href="#DEVICE_ACCESS">USB3 Vision Device Access</a>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>GenICam version 
   3.0.2 
   </b>. The corresponding files are part of the 
   HALCON runtime installation and are located in the directory 
   <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt>. 
   Since the HALCON GenICamTL interface sets all necessary environment 
   variables on its own, no environment variables like 
   <tt>GENICAM_ROOT_V2_x</tt>, <tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> 
   must be set or modified. Old variables referencing GenICam V1.1, V2.0 
   or V2.1 are not used anymore and should be deleted if not needed by other 
   software. See section <a href="#GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</a> 
   for more details. 
</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqUSB3Vision.dll</b> or 
   <b>hAcqUSB3Visionxl.dll</b>, respectively. Additionally you need 
   <b>libusb-1.0-usan.dll</b> and <b>libwdi-usan.dll</b> 3rd party libraries 
   and the <b>hAcqUSB3VisionElevate.exe</b> binary. The latter are 
   necessary to allow correct driver assignment from within the interface. 
   If you have properly installed the interface, all these files should 
   reside in <tt>bin\%HALCONARCH%</tt> within the HALCON base directory 
   %HALCONROOT% you have chosen during the installation of HALCON.<br> 
</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqUSB3Vision.so</b> or 
   <b>hAcqUSB3Visionxl.so</b>, respectively. Additionally you need the 
   <b>libusb-1.0-usan.so.0</b> 3rd party library and the 
   <b>hAcqUSB3VisionElevate</b> SUID binary (with s-bit for root). The latter 
   is necessary to allow correct device identification from within the 
   interface in case you do not have permissions to send commands to the 
   device. If you have properly installed the interface, the shared objects 
   should reside in <tt>lib/$HALCONARCH</tt>, the 3rd party shared library in 
   <tt>lib/$HALCONARCH/thirdparty</tt>, and the binary in 
   <tt>bin/$HALCONARCH</tt> within the HALCON base directory $HALCONROOT you 
   have chosen during the installation of HALCON.<br> 
   For device access libudev is required 
   (specifically <b>libudev.so.1</b> or higher) see 
   section <a href="#DEVICE_ACCESS">USB3 Vision Device Access</a>.<br> 
   For adapting priority and scheduling policy administrator privileges or 
   CAP_SYS_NICE capabilities are required, we suggest to add the capabilities 
   to the video group (default group when you use the provided udev 
   configuration) via an entry like <tt>@video - rtprio 99</tt> e.g. to 
   /etc/security/limits.d/video.conf (needs probably to be created). 
</li>
<li><b>macOS:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface 
   <b>hAcqUSB3Vision.dylib</b> or <b>hAcqUSB3Visionxl.dylib</b>, 
   respectively. Additionally you need the <b>libusb-1.0-usan.0.dylib</b> 3rd 
   party library. 
   If you have properly installed the interface, the shared 
   objects should reside in the HALCON framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework</tt> or the HALCON XL framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCONxl.framework</tt> in the <tt>Libraries</tt> 
   subdirectory. Alternatively you can set the environment variable 
   <tt>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> to point to the corresponding directory.<br> 
   For adapting priority and scheduling policy the necessary privileges are 
   required. 
</li>
<li><b>The default acquisition mode assumes the computer is fast enough to 
   process all buffers from the camera. If this is not the case, they 
   are silently discarded.</b>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="INSTALLATION">Installation</h2><div>Only when installing or updating the interface manually follow these steps: <br> 

<ul>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory %HALCONROOT% (Note: Administrator privileges may be 
  required for this step). Additionally, you have to move the interface 
  examples to the directory %HALCONEXAMPLES% manually. 
</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory $HALCONROOT. 
</li>
<li><b>OS X:</b> Extract the archive. Manually move the following files: 

<ul>
<li>The .dylib files located in lib/x64-macosx to 
     /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The genicam folder to /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The examples folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Users/Shared/Library/Application Support 
</li>
<li>The doc folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Library/Application Support
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="UPGRADING">Upgrading From Version 13.0.3 Or Earlier On Linux Systems</h2><div>  Starting with version 13.0.4, the shared library libusb-1.0-usan.so.0 is no   longer located in the directory <tt>$HALCONROOT/lib/$HALCONARCH/</tt>. 
  Instead, it is moved to the subdirectory 
  <tt>$HALCONROOT/lib/$HALCONARCH/thirdparty</tt>. If you are 
  upgrading from an earlier version of the interface, you will need to 
  manually remove this library from the directory 
  <tt>$HALCONROOT/lib/$HALCONARCH/</tt>.
</div>
<h2 id="ENV_VARS">Environment Variables</h2><div>The interface can be controlled through several environment variables: 
<ul>
<li><tt>HALCON_ACQUIRED_FILE_PAYLOAD_DIR</tt> is used to specify the directory 
  where non-image payload types (usually files or 'raw' data) are stored 
  using the filename given by the 
  device. 
</li>
<li>When specifying a directory with <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_XMLFILE</tt> 
  and/or <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_RAW_XMLFILE</tt>, the GenICam description 
  files (in XML and/or raw format) will be stored there while working with 
  HALCON. These files can also be stored by setting the interface parameter 
  'do_write_configuration'. 
</li>
<li>If you want to use an already installed GenApi version instead of the 
  one supplied with HALCON, you must set the environment variable 
  <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. Additionally, all environment variables 
  which are necessary for GenApi must also be set in this case. This is 
  only for experts, see also section 
  <a href="#GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</a>.
</li>
</ul></div>

<li>Due to a libusbx limitation on Windows, it is not possible to schedule 
   more than 64 USB transfers in parallel, see also 
   <a href="#ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</a> 
   for more details. 
</li>
<li>On OS X 10.10.x and older stopping or aborting grabbing images leads to 
   a hang for camera with large sensors (5MP and bigger). As a workaround 
   please open the interface with the generic parameter 'num_buffers=2' and 
   set the parameter '[Stream]StreamAuxiliaryBufferCount' to 0. Apple fixed 
   this problem with OS X 10.11 'El Capitan'.

<h2 id="GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>This interface uses GenApi version    3.0.2, 
   for more details refer to the <a href="http://www.genicam.org/">GenICam homepage</a>. The 
   corresponding files are part of the HALCON runtime installation and are 
   located in the directory <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base 
   directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt> or <tt>$HALCONROOT</tt>, respectively. 
   This version is the same as the officially released version at the time 
   of writing. 
</li>
<li>The HALCON USB3Vision interface sets all necessary environment 
   variables on its own and ignores other installed GenICam 
   packages by default.<br> 
   If you want to use another GenICam package, you need to set the 
   environment variable <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. This skips 
   the step of setting all necessary variables and paths internally, so 
   you have to make sure they are set correctly. Please note that it might 
   not be possible to use different GenApi versions with different interfaces 
   at the same time and that you must use the required GenApi version for 
   this interface. 
</li>
<li>The caching of device XML files is activated to speed up processing, 
   Windows uses <tt>%TEMP%</tt> and Linux/macOS use <tt>$TMP</tt> or 
   <tt>/tmp</tt> if <tt>$TMP</tt> is not set for cached XML files.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="USB3_VISION">USB3 Vision</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>This interface implements USB3 Vision specification version 1.0, covering    all three basic protocols it defines: control, image/data streaming and 
   asynchronous device events. 
</li>
<li>The device features control is accessed via GenApi. 
</li>
<li>To provide a consistent user experience, the control features of the 
   USB3 Vision Producer of this interface are also controlled via 
   GenApi.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="DEVICE_ACCESS">USB3 Vision Device Access</h2><div> The HALCON USB3Vision image acquisition interface performs all access to the  USB bus and connected USB devices through a libusb 1.x compatible interface. 
 To ensure full access to the device, the following preconditions have to be 
 fulfilled:<br><br> 
 <b>General:</b> 

<ul>
<li>The device has to be compatible with USB 3.0 and operate in the SuperSpeed 
   transfer mode. 
</li>
<li>USB 2.0 (or lower) devices or devices connected through USB 2.0 hub 
   will be discovered by the interface, but they will be marked as inaccessible 
   and the interface will refuse to open them. 
</li>
<li>Note that when using an improper cable or when the cable connector is not fully 
   plugged, the device might appear to be connected through USB 2.0 as well. 
</li>
</ul> 
 <b>Windows:</b> 

<ul>
<li>On Windows, the access to the devices can be established through one of the 
   following drivers: WinUSB, libusb-win32 or libusbk, while we currently 
   recommend WinUSB as a default option. 
</li>
<li>The driver has to be attached to the composite parent of the device, not just 
   to one of the device interfaces. 
</li>
<li>If the driver is not properly attached to the device, the HALCON 
   USB3Vision acquisition interface will discover the device, but will 
   mark it as inaccessible and opening it will not be possible. 
</li>
<li>If you are using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant, it will 
   automatically prompt you to add the correct generic parameter to install 
   the driver if necessary. You can find an example in section 
   <a href="#HDEVELOP_EXAMPLES">HDevelop Examples</a> 
   if you want to do this manually. 
   Please keep in mind that due to the necessary privilege elevation network 
   drives might not be available to the elevated user and therefore driver 
   installation might fail. Install HALCON locally if you see these kind of 
   problems. 
</li>
<li>If you are using other image acquisition interfaces or other software 
   to access the camera it might be necessary to use a different driver then 
   the one this interface assigns. This is done by opening the device 
   manager with administrative permissions. Then select the device, 
   right click on it and choose to uninstall the driver. Please select the 
   option to remove the driver, else it will be assigned automatically when 
   you reconnect the device. Now unplug the device and reconnect it. It 
   should install the other driver, if not please follow the instructions 
   of the other software or interface. 
</li>
<li>If the interface is not able to detect the device at all, you need 
   to assign the driver manually. Before doing so update, the driver for 
   your USB 3.0 host controller to the newest available version from the 
   manufacturer, most of the time this enables automatic detection 
   afterwards. 
</li>
<li>The recommended way to install the driver manually is to use the <a href="http://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a> 
   driver installer (latest version). Run the tool with Administrator privileges, 
   in Options menu check 'List All Devices' and uncheck 'Ignore Hubs or Composite Parents'. 
   Select your device (important: its composite parent) in the drop-down list 
   and install the driver (e.g., WinUSB) to be used with the device. 
</li>
</ul> 
 <b>Linux:</b> 

<ul>
<li>On Linux, the enumeration and access to the devices is established through 
   libudev (using usbfs as a fallback). At least <b>libudev.so.1</b> is required. 
</li>
<li>The application needs sufficient privileges to open the device file in read-write 
   mode. Without read-write access, the device might not be even properly enumerated, 
   because the essential USB3 Vision related information about the device couldn't 
   be queried. 
</li>
<li>If you are using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant, it will 
   automatically prompt you to add the correct generic parameter to add missing 
   permissions if necessary. 
</li>
<li>To allow to fully access the devices from a regular user account, the system's 
   udev subsystem should be configured to guarantee read-write access for device 
   files corresponding with any USB3 Vision devices possibly connected to the system. 
   The actual udev configuration strategy might be system-specific, however, 
   a default solution suitable in most situations is packed together with 
   the USB3Vision acquisition interface. 
</li>
<li>You can find the recommended udev configuration rule in 
   <tt>$HALCONROOT/misc/linux/udev/rules.d/59-usb3vision.rules</tt>. This rule will guarantee 
   read-write access to device files corresponding with USB3 Vision devices 
   for all members of the 'video' user group plus to the users logged in interactively 
   to the system. When such configuration matches your expectations, copy the 
   file to <tt>/etc/udev/rules.d</tt> directory (valid on most distributions). 
   When desired, modify the file according to the udev configuration strategy 
   defined for your system. 
</li>
<li>As an additional last resort helper, for situations when the udev rules 
   configuration fails to help (e.g. because another software package overrides it), 
   the USB3Vision acquisition interface will try to use the utility 
   <tt>$HALCONROOT/bin/$HALCONARCH/hAcqUSB3VisionElevate</tt> during device discovery. 
   The only purpose of this utility is to read USB3 Vision related identity of the device 
   to allow full device discovery. However, this tool needs reliable read-write access 
   to the USB3 Vision device files, regardless of the actual user and the udev configuration. 
   It is therefore recommended that the file owner is changed to root and setuid bit set. 
   To achieve this you can need to execute the following commands as root: 
   <tt>chown root $HALCONROOT/bin/$HALCONARCH/hAcqUSB3VisionElevate</tt> 
   <tt>chmod 2755 $HALCONROOT/bin/$HALCONARCH/hAcqUSB3VisionElevate</tt> 
</li>
<li>The Linux kernel limits the size of buffers allocated for the USB 
   transfers to 16MB. For cameras with large sensors, multiple cameras, lots 
   of simultaneous scheduled transfers or similar (see also 
   <a href="#ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</a>) 
   this limit is not sufficient and needs to be adjusted.  To prevent image 
   acquisition failures, it is necessary to increase this limit to a value 
   that safely covers the total size of stream buffer transfers that might be 
   concurrently scheduled for all open cameras at any moment - considering 
   also other possible components or applications that could be sharing the 
   USB subsystem with your application.  The limit is controlled by the 
   usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb kernel parameter (as size in MB). For example to 
   increase this limit to 512MB you can add a kernel command line parameter 
   like <tt>usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=512</tt> when booting or to your 
   bootloader.  Alternatively, you can adjust it on the fly as administrator 
   privileges by executing <tt>echo 512 > 
   /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb </tt>. 
</li>
</ul> 
 <b>macOS:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Nothing special has to be done, you should have full device access by 
   default. 
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="MULTIPLE_CAMERAS">Using Multiple Cameras</h2><div>When using multiple USB3 Vision cameras simultaneously, some bandwidth management considerations might be necessary when planning the hardware setup. 
In particular, it is important to guarantee that the total bandwidth possibly 
used by the devices does not exceed the bandwidth of the USB bus topology segment 
they eventually share &ndash; or, if possible, guarantee that the devices are connected 
to the host via independent paths.<br><br> 
Note that the actual performance of USB components such as hubs might be significantly 
lower than the maximum theoretical USB 3.0 bus bandwidth.<br><br> 
Depending on the actual use case, the particular device properties, such as the presence 
and size of the device's frame buffer might also play a role on the overall system 
performance and reliability. Device vendors usually provide detailed guidelines 
and configuration options for bandwidth management of their devices.<br><br> 
Due to a limitation of the libusbx library on Windows, special care might be 
required when using more than two cameras. You must configure the interface 
to ensure that not more than 64 transfers can be scheduled at any moment. 
Refer to sections 
<a href="#ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</a> and 
<a href="#ADVANCED_EVENT_CONTROL">Advanced Event Engine Control</a> for 
corresponding instructions.
</div>
<h2 id="OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</h2><div>The connection to the (acquisition) device is established through the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> operator. The operator provides a set of parameters 
allowing to configure the basic properties of the device and how the 
HALCON USB3Vision interface controls it &ndash; 
see <a href="#OPEN_FRAMEGRABBER">corresponding section</a>. Some of the parameters 
can be also modified at runtime through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>. 
This section concentrates solely on the 'Device' parameter 
of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, identifying the device (usually camera) 
that should be opened.<br> 
A connection to the device accessible through the USB3Vision 
interface is established using the device ID which is guaranteed to be 
unique per USB3 Vision device and stays persistent 
across multiple sessions and independent on the point where the device 
is connected to the USB bus. 
The list of all devices currently available in the system can be at any 
point obtained using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> parameter 'device' or 'info_boards' &ndash; 
see <a href="#INFO_FRAMEGRABBER">corresponding section</a>. Both parameters 
return a list of devices, each specified using the above listed entities in the format 
<tt>' | device:&lt;device id&gt; | ...'</tt>, where <tt>'&lt;device id&gt;'</tt> 
is either the unique device ID or a user-defined name ('DeviceUserID') 
if the device supports it. If set, the string obtained by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> 
will contain the entry <tt>'user_name:&lt;user-defined name&gt;'</tt>. 
To make it easier for the user, the <tt>'device'</tt> entry reflects 
the user-defined name if it is unique. If the same user-defined name 
is assigned to more than one device, only the first one will use it, 
all others will use the unique name instead. 
The full string (obtained from the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> call) can be directly used 
for the 'Device' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, it uses the same format. 
Only the <tt>' | device:&lt;device id&gt;'</tt> string entry is important for <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, 
the others are ignored and might be omitted. <br><br> 
If you know the device ID in advance, you can create the string yourself 
&ndash; without using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a>. As shown above, it consists of entries 
separated by ' | ', the <tt>'device'</tt> entry being the only significant one.<br> 
When a string without any ' | ' separator is used, it is interpreted directly 
as the device ID.<br> 
As a special case, the string 'default' can be used &ndash; in this case the HALCON 
acquisition interface will use the first available device (devices currently reported 
as non-accessible will be skipped). Note that when using 
the same 'default' string again, that device will no more be accessible, therefore the 
next accessible device will be opened. This way, all devices connected to the system 
may be easily opened in a loop. 
<p><i> 
Note that in future versions of the USB3 Vision specification, support for devices 
with multiple image streams might be added &ndash; in such a case the format to open 
the device will be extended with the stream entry. The current format would open 
the first available stream.<br> 
Similarly, in future the device string format might be extended with 
a entry specifying the <tt>'interface'</tt> (i.e., the computer's USB 3.0 bus) 
to which the device is connected. In such a case, the current format would still 
work, searching all interfaces instead of just the one specified. 
</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</h2><div>The features of a device or USB3 Vision Producer are described by GenICam feature description files (XML files) that are automatically parsed 
and offered to the user. The HALCON USB3Vision image acquisition interface 
provides access to the features exposed through the following GenICam feature 
description files: 

<ul>
<li>Features of the connected device 
  ("remote device"), 
  typically a camera, are usually loaded directly from the connected device. 
</li>
<li>Features of the USB3 Vision Producer are exposed through 
  a set of GenICam description files, one for each internal entity to control 
  the device tree: 

<ul>
<li>The "system" &ndash; representing the overall behavior of the acquisition 
     interface 
</li>
<li>The interface used to connect the device to the system. 
</li>
<li>A proxy (called "local device") to the device, controlling the 
     USB3 Vision Producer view of the device. 
</li>
<li>The data stream used for the acquisition (if the device provides any 
     data streams). 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul> 
In most cases the GenICam description files are provided by the device and 
the USB3 Vision Producer. It is possible to store a copy of these 
files corresponding to an open connection by using the parameter 
<tt>'do_write_configuration'</tt> (see <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>). 
The command will write all the GenICam 
description files and an "ini" file (details in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) with 
various information, including the location of the written GenICam 
description files, in the following format: 
<pre> 
RemoteFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE% 
SystemFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfaceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DeviceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_LOCAL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
The same ini-file format can be reused to force the HALCON acquisition 
interface to load an alternative XML file for one or more of these entities. 
This can be useful, e.g., for updates or troubleshooting. 
The files listed in the ini file will be used for the given entity instead of 
the original ones. For the entities excluded from the ini file, the GenICam 
description file will be searched and loaded the usual way. To apply the ini 
file, pass its full path to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> in the 'CameraType' 
parameter.<br><br> 
Note that the ini-file can be reused also for other purposes such as 
storing/restoring configuration as described in 
<a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</h2><div>The following groups of parameters exist: 
<ul>
<li>Internal parameters of the HALCON USB3Vision image acquisition 
  interface itself. These are named following the "underscore" naming 
  style, e.g., <tt>color_space</tt>, and are all lowercase. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the 
  device, usually a camera, use by 
  convention the "CamelCase" style, e.g., <tt>ExposureTime</tt>. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the individual USB3 Vision Producer 
  modules (system, interface, device and data stream) use by convention 
  the same style but are prefixed with the module name in square brackets. 
  Beware that the system and interface modules might potentially be shared by 
  multiple opened devices, so changing their configuration might have side 
  effects on other connections as well. The following prefixes are used: 

<ul>
<li>"[System]", e.g., <tt>[System]TLVendorName</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Interface]", e.g., <tt>[Interface]InterfaceType</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Device]", e.g., <tt>[Device]DeviceID</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Stream]", e.g., <tt>[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode</tt>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</h2><div>The parameters belonging to the system and interface modules of the USB3 Vision Producer (ie. those with "[System]" and "[Interface]" prefix see 
<a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a> ) must be treated in a special way.<br> 
To grasp their behavior, it is important to understand that they do not describe 
or configure the device itself and do not thus fully belong to the opened instance of the device.<br> 
The interface module parameters belong to the interface on which given device was discovered 
and is shared among all devices open under this interface (see also 
<a href="#OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</a>). 
The system module parameters belong to the entire USB3 Vision Producer and are shared 
among all devices open within this USB3 Vision Producer.<br> 
This has several implications. In particular, when accessing the system or interface module parameters 
through multiple device instances, those parameters must be treated as shared resources. 
Modifying those parameters through one device instance affects their values (and possibly values 
of other features depending on them) as seen through other device instances. Initial values of those 
parameters after opening a device instance might depend on the interactions with these features 
from previously opened device instances.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_TYPES">Parameters &ndash; GenICam Data Types</h2><div>HALCON native parameter types are 
<ul>
<li><tt>integer</tt> &ndash; signed integer, 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, 32-bit on 
  32-bit ones 
</li>
<li><tt>real</tt> &ndash; floating point type 
</li>
<li><tt>string</tt> &ndash; classical string 
</li>
</ul> 
When accessing GenICam-based features, the GenICam data types must be mapped 
to the parameter types recognized by HALCON. GenICam offers the following 
types: 

<ul>
<li><tt>IInteger</tt> &ndash; integer value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>real</tt> 
  parameters and when the GenICam feature in question is identified to be an 
  IP or MAC address, the string representation of the address will also be 
  accepted.  It should be highlighted that a problem can occur when running 
  HALCON on a 32-bit platform (where <tt>integer</tt> parameters are 32-bit 
  wide) and accessing a GenICam feature that is naturally 64-bit. In such 
  cases the full range of the feature will not be available to the 
  application and its value might be truncated. Also the sign of the 
  parameter might be misinterpreted. To solve this problem, the parameter 
  'split_param_values_into_dwords' can be used. This maps the 64-bit IInteger 
  value into two 32-bit integer values and vice versa. 
</li>
<li><tt>IFloat</tt> &ndash; floating point value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>real</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameters. 
</li>
<li><tt>IString</tt> &ndash; string value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type. 
</li>
<li><tt>IBoolean</tt> &ndash; boolean type is handled through HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameters, a value of 0 (zero) means logical false, other 
  values mean logical true. 
</li>
<li><tt>IEnumeration</tt> &ndash; enumeration is a type that allows selecting from 
  a set of values that are primarily identified by their name (the values are 
  called 'enum entries'). Enumerations are interfaced through HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type, while the enum entry names are used as the 
  parameter values. 
</li>
<li><tt>ICommand</tt> &ndash; The command type allows to "execute" actions. To 
  execute a command, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> with an <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameter of any value (the value is ignored). Some commands' execution 
  might take longer time and the command provides feedback when it is done. 
  To query the status, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> for that command. It will 
  return an <tt>integer</tt> value of 1 if it "is done" (command execution 
  has finished), 0 if it has not finished yet.  Note that if some other features 
  are designed to be dependent on the command, querying the "is done" status 
  might be essential to get the depending features invalidated (and updated 
  with new values) as soon as the command execution finishes. 
</li>
<li><tt>IRegister</tt> &ndash; The register data type is used for plain memory blobs 
  that cannot be mapped to any other data type. They are interfaced through 
  HALCON's <tt>string</tt> parameter type, the register value is the 
  hexadecimal string representation of the register's memory.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</h2><div>The current status of the device settings (values of all the parameters defining its working state) might be persisted while no acquisition 
is active, i.e. before <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> or after 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', 1)</tt>. 
The persistence functionality consists of two steps, storing the current configuration 
to a file and later re-loading it back to the device. 
The current device settings can be stored using the 'do_write_settings' parameter 
and re-loaded later using the 'do_load_settings' parameter, specifying the desired 
persistence file path in both cases.<br><br> 
Note that while the format of the file is intentionally human readable and the file 
can be hand-modified if desired, such modifications should be done with care 
by someone familiar with the GenICam persistence functionality internals and given 
device. Improper modifications of the file can lead to errors when using it.<br><br> 
It is important to know that while performed by the software, the feature settings 
persistence is actually a camera-side function. If the persistence support is implemented 
incorrectly or incompletely by the device, it will not work as expected &ndash; in such 
a case the camera manufacturer could provide additional information or help.<br><br> 
The same persistence file can be applied to the entire set of devices of the same type 
and firmware version. Applying the persistence file to a device of another type 
or using even different firmware version will probably lead to inconsistencies 
or will even fail completely &ndash; the corresponding device manufacturer should provide 
guidelines for such use cases.<br><br> 
Apart from the 'do_write_settings', the feature persistence file will also be written 
together with the ini file documented in the section 
<a href="#XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</a> - using parameter 
'do_write_configuration'. This command 
will also generate persistence files for all the USB3 Vision Producer modules 
(system, interface, device and data stream). 
The persistence file entries in the ini file 
will have the format 
<pre> 
RemotePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE%</tt> 
SystemPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfacePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DevicePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_LOCAL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
If the persistence functionality is not supported properly (or at all) by a given 
device, use the GenICam features UserSetSave/UserSetLoad, if supported by the device. 
These features will allow to store/load the device settings in the device's 
non-volatile memory.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OVERVIEW">Acquisition &ndash; Overview, Device Control</h2><div>The image acquisition can be either synchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>) or asynchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>), 
see the reference documentation of the operators.<br> 
The interface fully configures and controls the acquisition process on the 
camera. 
Note that some of the camera 
features might be locked by GenICam when an acquisition is active.<br> 
With synchronous grab (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>), a new acquisition is started 
internally for each image, so that the application always gets a new image. 
Before delivering the image, the acquisition is stopped again, so between 
individual <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a> calls, all acquisition related features 
remain unlocked.<br> 
With asynchronous grabbing, started explicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or 
implicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>, the interface keeps the 
acquisition running internally, collecting further images to be delivered 
through future <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> calls. The acquisition related 
features are locked, until the acquisition is stopped using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.<br> 
Note that the interface properly recognizes the 'Continuous', 'SingleFrame' 
and 'MultiFrame' acquisition modes configured on the device and adjusts the 
acquisition control logic accordingly.<br> 
Note that the HALCON acquisition interface itself takes over exclusive access 
to several remote device features essential for the acquisition control 
(AcquisitionStart, AcquisitionStop, AcquisitionAbort, TLParamsLocked). The 
user application has no direct way to control these features.<br> 
The differences between the "image" and "data" version of the grab operators 
is documented in 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</h2><div>The interface allocates 4 buffers for the acquisition engine by default (the number of buffers can be changed through the 'Generic' parameter of 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>).<br> 
Whenever a new image is acquired successfully and passed to the application 
as a HALCON image, the interface keeps the buffer locked (not returning it to 
the acquisition engine) until a new grab-related operator is called by the 
application or the acquisition is aborted using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.  During this 
period, it is fully safe to query information about this "last acquired" 
buffer &ndash; for example query buffer properties through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> 
parameters such as 'buffer_timestamp', 'buffer_is_incomplete', 
'image_width' and 'image_height'. This applies also to 
<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a> 
eventually present in the buffer and is also usable in volatile 
mode.<br> 
When a new grab-related operator is called by the application, the interface 
returns the buffer to the acquisition engine and buffer-related queries are 
not valid anymore. 
<br><br> 
It can happen, that the camera is temporarily or constantly acquiring data 
in higher speed than the application is processing them. In such case the 
streaming engine of the USB3 Vision Producer decides how to treat 
the acquired buffers based on the '[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode' 
parameter. 
<br><br> 
Note that the streaming engine behavior can be further controlled through 
additional parameters described in 
<a href="#ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_IMAGE_FORMAT">Acquisition &ndash; Image Format Handling</h2><div>With modern, generic image acquisition interfaces an application cannot make valid assumptions about the image format coming from the device based on the 
current settings. Some devices for example allow changing the image format 
properties while the acquisition is active. 
<br> 
The HALCON USB3Vision image acquisition interface fully supports these 
use cases.  It checks the image format and other important properties of 
every single buffer and generates HALCON images corresponding to both the 
acquired image format and eventual user configured output format parameters 
such as 'color_space' and 'bits_per_channel'. Only if the necessary 
information about the buffer are missing 
, the current settings are used as a fallback.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</h2><div>The acquisition interface provides two mechanisms for acquisition of the image (or other) data from the device, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> and 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>. Each of them might be more suitable for different 
use cases. Internally, both mechanisms work exactly the same (in particular 
how they acquire and process the data from the device), they differ in the way 
how the outputs are provided to the application.<br> 
The "traditional" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators are still well suitable 
in simple use cases when just a single 2D image is acquired from the device. 
It is also currently used e.g. by the HDevelop's Image Acquisition Assistant. 
However, in case when the device is streaming more complex data structures, 
such as 3D data, multi-AOI or similar data, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> 
is not able to provide all the outputs. In all these cases it will simply 
provide the first image found in the acquired data.<br> 
The "extended" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators allow to output arbitrary 
number of HALCON images and also arbitrary number of control data. It is therefore 
suitable for use in advanced use cases when more than just a single HALCON image 
should be output. An important use case is acquisition from 3D devices 
(<a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>) when the operators can build and output 
the 3D object model through the control data output. It can be also used 
in other (possibly even device-specific) situations when the device outputs 
multiple images for a single acquisition.<br> 
The structure of the provided outputs can be queried with help of the 
'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.<br> 
The <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> can also be used in the simple single-image 
use cases - in that case they will simply provide a single HALCON image 
and zero control data outputs. They can thus be used as full replacement 
of the traditional <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators.
</div>
<h2 id="USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</h2><div>The acquisition interface fully supports the GenICam standard 3D device model and is thus capable to seamlessly integrate 3D devices compliant with this 
model. This means in particular that the application does not need to care 
about device-specific ways of 3D data formatting, the acquisition interface 
will generate the 3D data under the hood using the information from the device.<br> 
If instructed so (using the 'create_objectmodel3d' parameter), the acquisition 
interface will generate the 3D object model from the coordinate data acquired 
from the device. This model can be directly used by the HALCON's 3D object model 
related operators.<br> 
The completeness and accuracy of the final 3D object model strongly depends 
on the actual coordinate data and in particular on the 3D configuration information 
provided by the device. Because the 3D configuration metadata are typically passed 
from the device through the chunk data mechanism 
(<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a>), it is essential to observe that 
the chunk data generation is fully enabled on the device.<br> 
If some of the important 3D configuration information is missing, the acquisition 
interface will try to use the suitable defaults, but the quality of the 3D object 
model output can be lowered.<br> 
The creation of the 3D object model can be further affected by additional parameters 
such as 'coordinate_transform_mode', 'confidence_mode', 'confidence_threshold', 
'add_objectmodel3d_overlay_attrib'.<br> 
Note: for devices not complying with the GenICam standard 3D device model 
the HALCON 3D object model cannot be automatically generated.<br> 
Note that the 3D object model output is only supported by the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> 
operators, it cannot be acquired using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>. Besides the 
3D object model, the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators also output the actual 
raw coordinate data in form of HALCON images. The individual outputs can be identified 
with help of 'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format &ndash; Custom Pixel Formats, Non-image Buffers</h2><div>The HALCON USB3Vision image acquisition interface has a built-in converter from the pixel formats described in the GenICam Standard Features Naming 
Convention to the desired HALCON image format. The parameters ColorSpace 
and BitsPerChannel (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, eventually <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) 
define the desired format of the resulting HALCON image.  If these parameters 
are set to defaults, the original pixel format coming from the device is 
preserved.<br> 
To offer a basic support of custom pixel formats (i.e., pixel formats not 
defined by PFNC or not supported by HALCON), the ColorSpace value 'raw' can 
be used. In this case the image acquisition interface delivers the buffer to the 
application without any format conversions.<br> 
Note that the same principle is applied whenever a buffer containing other 
than image data is acquired. Examples of such buffers can be files (e.g., 
compressed images) or raw data (results of smart camera processing). Such 
buffers are not real "images", but can still be delivered to the application 
as 'raw' HALCON images. It is the responsibility of the application to know 
how to interpret such data.<br> 
Last but not least, the 'raw' color space can also be used if the user explicitly wishes 
to receive raw input data without any conversions. For example when 
acquiring Bayer encoded images, specifying 'raw' means that the interface 
should not attempt to decode them to RGB or monochrome format, but deliver 
the data directly to the application.<br> 
It is important to know that when the interface does not have full information 
about the image format (dimensions and pixel format), it has to choose an 
artificial one.  In such a case it delivers always an 8-bit image with 
dimensions matching the buffer size (square root of the image size). 
Eventually an unused tail of the HALCON image (if such an artificial image is 
bigger than the source buffer) will be padded with zeroes.  The fact whether 
the last acquired buffer contained an image of known properties or a blob of 
other data (so that the artificial HALCON image size had to be used) as well 
as the size of the eventual tail padding can be queried using 
'raw_buffer_type' and 'raw_buffer_padding_bytes' parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible cameras can deliver additional meta-data with every image in a so-called chunk data format. It is usually necessary to enable 
the delivery of individual meta-data "chunks" using the features 
'ChunkModeActive' and 'ChunkSelector'/'ChunkEnable' first.<br> 
The decoding of the chunk data and matching them to the corresponding camera 
features is performed transparently by the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism, i.e., <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. The choice of the meta-data to be 
delivered is device-specific. The names of the chunk related features usually 
start by convention with a prefix 'Chunk' (examples might be 
'ChunkExposureTime' or 'ChunkGain'), however, the camera documentation should 
contain all the information about supported chunks and their corresponding 
feature names.<br> 
It is important to remember, that the chunk data related features will 
provide only meaningful values if the "last acquired buffer" is valid, i.e., 
between delivery of the last image and next call to any grab-related operator 
(refer to section 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</a>).
</div>
<h2 id="FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</h2><div>It is possible to receive notifications about changes of any features exposed through the GenICam interface by the camera and USB3 Vision Producer.<br> 
Note that the notifications might be raised in various circumstances, 
including: 

<ul>
<li>The application (you) explicitly changed that feature. 
</li>
<li>Another feature has changed and the notified feature "depends" on the 
  changed feature (the dependencies are defined in the GenICam description 
  file). 
</li>
<li>Access mode or current range for the feature has changed. 
</li>
<li>As a result of regular "polling" in case of uncached features. 
</li>
<li>As a result of device event delivery if the feature is connected to that 
  event. 
</li>
<li>As a result of new buffer delivery for features corresponding to chunk 
  data. 
</li>
</ul> 
Note that the notifications are raised whenever the feature is "marked dirty" 
(its cache invalidated) by one of the actions described above. It does not 
necessarily mean that its value has really changed, it is up to the 
application to check this.<br> 
Notification callbacks can be registered for individual features using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> - see <a href="#SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">corresponding 
operator documentation</a>. Additionally, it is possible to use 
message queues to receive the event notification. In those cases it is necessary 
to create a message queue and then register the individual feature - see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">event message queues</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_DATA">Event Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible devices can deliver asynchronous events which optionally carry additional data. It is usually necessary to enable delivery 
of individual event types using the features 
'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' first. 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The decoding of the event data and matching them to the corresponding 
features, including potential notifications, is performed transparently by 
the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism like <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> or by get_message_tuple if you are 
using message queues to receive events. The choice of the event types to be 
generated is device-specific.  The names of the event related features 
usually start by convention with a prefix 'Event' (examples might be 
'EventFrameTrigger' and 'EventFrameTriggerTimestamp'), however, the device 
documentation should contain all the information about supported events and 
their corresponding feature names.<br> 
Although the data corresponding to the last delivered event can be in general 
read at any time, when using callback to receive events it is highly recommended 
that reading the event data is synchronized to notifications for corresponding 
event feature(s). Only in such a case it is guaranteed that the read data correspond 
exactly to the very event instance being notified &ndash; and that the feature 
values are not just being modified through a new instance of the same event. 
Note that the notifications are raised from context of the event handling/dispatching 
thread, so when processing the user callback, the event handling mechanism is 
paused. If multiple data items are associated with the same event, it is 
enough to register notification just for the actual event feature and read 
all the data during the callback.<br> 
If using message queues to receive events, you can decide to add additional data 
to be delivered with the corresponding event feature(s), see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
For this case the interface will read all the specified event features 
as soon as the event is generated and add it to the corresponding message. 
This guarantees that the delivered information corresponds with the actual 
value at the time the event was generated.<br> 
Besides the asynchronous events generated by the actual device, asynchronous 
events (optionally including additional data) can be generated by any 
module of the USB3 Vision Producer (system, interface, device 
and data stream). The information provided above about handling of the device 
events applies similarly also to the USB3 Vision Producer events, 
including enabling/disabling them (typically using 'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' 
features provided by given module, i.e. with corresponding module prefix 
in the feature name). 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The interface will automatically capture and decode the events and match them 
to the corresponding USB3 Vision Producer features. It is only important 
to understand that because the system and interface modules are potentially 
shared among multiple opened devices 
(see <a href="#PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</a>) and so, 
the same applies for asynchronous events generated by these shared modules.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</h2><div> This interface supports feature change notifications via message queues.  Select the desired target feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_selector', ...)</tt>. 
 It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a>).<br> 
 Create a message queue at which you want to receive the notifications with 
 <tt>create_message_queue</tt> and assign it to the selected feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', QueueHandle)</tt>.<br> 
 The message queue can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and USB3 Vision Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_event_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a> and 
 <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</a> sections.<br> 
 A new message would be added to the specified queue whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value. 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', 0)</tt> 
 unregisters the previously registered message queue from the specified event. 
 Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new message queue for a feature that already had a message queue registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one.<br> 
 The messages incoming on an event can be retrieved with 
 <tt>dequeue_message</tt> and will contain at least three tuples. 
 The first tuple (key 'id') is a unique identifier of the acquisition 
 instance the event is coming from. It is a string composed as 
 '&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;'. The second tuple (key 'event_name') 
 is the name of the corresponding feature previously specified by 
 'event_selector'. The third tuple (key 'event_value') contains the value 
 if the corresponding feature if available. 
 If you decide to add additional data to be delivered with the 
 corresponding event feature(s), add the features of interest with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_data', ...)</tt>. 
 Each event data feature will be appended to the event message 
 with the key being its name and the tuple its value if available.
</div>
<h2 id="ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</h2><div>The streaming engine works well for standard use cases. However, in specific use cases, the behavior must be fine tuned. The parameters 
described in this section are intended for this advanced use only 
and should be treated with care - wrong configuration can 
significantly affect performance.<br> 
As the streaming engine and the event engine share the same 
resources (such as the cpu time and USB subsystem) it is recommended 
to consider both of them (see 
<a href="#ADVANCED_EVENT_CONTROL">Advanced Event Engine Control</a>).<br> 
In particular if the frame rate of the camera exceeds the rate the 
application can handle the images it is necessary to adjust the 
behavior. If possible this use case should be avoided by setting 
appropriate parameters in the camera, e.g. by using triggering 
instead of free running acquisition mode.<br> 
For optimal performance when streaming over USB it is usually 
necessary to ensure that there is always a buffer ready to receive 
data and that this buffer is also "scheduled" for USB transfers to the 
system's USB subsystem. In any other case the camera might decide to 
discard the image, deliver only part of the image (especially if the 
camera has no or limited frame buffer) or even start 
misbehaving.<br> 
As described in 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</a>, 
the acquisition interface allocates a set of buffers used to deliver 
the acquired data to the user application ("user buffers").  If the 
application can not handle the frame rate of the camera, it will 
happen that all of these buffers are filled and are waiting in the 
output queue for processing, thus no user buffer can be temporarily 
scheduled for the next acquisition. For this reason, the streaming 
engine allocates '[Stream]StreamAuxiliaryBufferCount' auxiliary 
buffers (default 2). The number can be decreased (down to zero) to 
save memory if necessary or it can be further increased, if the 
default count is too low to prevent overflows but in this case 
it might be better to schedule more user buffers.<br> 
The minimum number of buffers the streaming engine tries to keep 
scheduled at any moment can be adjusted by 
'[Stream]StreamScheduledBuffersTarget'.  To satisfy this target 
auxiliary buffers are being scheduled when there are not enough user 
buffers available. Especially with fast cameras the scheduled 
buffers might be quickly exhausted if the streaming thread is not 
scheduled for a while, thus the default value of 2 needs to be 
increased.<br> 
If an image has been acquired into an auxiliary buffer, the 
streaming engine checks if a new user buffer became available in the 
meanwhile. If not, the engine checks the 
'[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode' parameter to see if it is allowed 
to overwrite older buffers awaiting processing in the output queue. 
If there is a user buffer available the data is copied to it, 
otherwise it is discarded. Making use of auxiliary buffers thus 
always yields additional overhead for copying.<br> 
Contrary to the above, there are also cases, e.g. using multiple 
cameras, when it is necessary to limit the number of scheduled 
buffers (per camera). The main reason is a limitation under Windows 
of the underlying libusbx library that is not capable of handling 
more than 64 USB transfers scheduled in parallel. That number must 
not be exceeded. The interface schedules USB transfers for multiple 
purposes: camera control, streaming (image acquisition) and device 
event delivery.<br> 
Up to 2 transfers should be reserved for the camera control, 3-4 
transfers typically for each scheduled buffer and some transfers are 
scheduled to listen for incoming device events 
(<a href="#ADVANCED_EVENT_CONTROL">Advanced Event Engine Control</a>). 
This adds up to a total number of concurrently scheduled transfers:<br> 
<center><tt>NTransfers = NCameras * 
            [([Stream]StreamScheduledBuffersMaximum * 4) + 
              [Device]DeviceScheduledEventsMaximum + 2]</tt></center><br> 
If the streaming engine schedules 4 buffers (12-16 transfers), 
together with the control and event transfers, the number of 
concurrently scheduled transfers is about 20. Using multiple cameras 
the limit of 64 can be reached easily. To limit the number of 
transfers, the maximal number of buffers the streaming engine will 
attempt to schedule can be adjusted by the 
'[Stream]StreamScheduledBuffersMaximum' parameter.<br> 
The ability to schedule buffers in time has a heavy effect 
on the performance of the streaming engine. This is strongly 
affected by the priority of the streaming engine thread relative to 
other threads in the system. Refer to the documentation of the 
parameters '[Stream]StreamThreadPriority', 
'[Stream]StreamThreadSchedulingPolicy' and 
'[Stream]StreamThreadApplyPriority' for details. Upon device open, 
generally suitable default priority is selected.<br> 
Finally, the streaming infrastructure can be completely disabled 
using the 'streaming_mode=0' generic parameter while opening the 
device.
</div>
<h2 id="ADVANCED_EVENT_CONTROL">Advanced Event Engine Control</h2><div>The event engine works well for standard use cases. However, in specific use cases, the behavior must be fine tuned. The parameters 
described in this section are intended for this advanced use only 
and should be treated with care - wrong configuration can 
significantly affect performance.<br> 
Fine tuning the event engine is very similar to adjusting the 
streaming engine. Since they share the same resources (such as the 
cpu time and USB subsystem) it makes sense to consider both of them. 
It is therefore recommended to study the corresponding explanations in 
(<a href="#ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</a>), 
this section will just list the corresponding event related 
parameters.<br> 
Unlike the streaming engine, the event engine uses all buffers only 
internally. The engine will attempt to schedule as many transfers 
for incoming events as possible, but not more than specified by the 
'[Device]DeviceScheduledEventsMaximum' parameter. 
This parameter is currently read only (default 2) - it might become 
writeable in a future version of the interface.<br> 
The event engine thread priority is controlled by the parameters 
'[Device]DeviceEventsThreadPriority', 
'[Device]DeviceEventsThreadSchedulingPolicy' 
and '[Device]DeviceEventsThreadApplyPriority'. 
Upon device open, generally suitable default priority is selected.<br> 
The event handling infrastructure can be completely disabled 
using the 'device_event_handling=0' generic parameter while opening 
the device.

<h2 id="USING_HDEVELOP_IMAGE_ACQUISITION_ASSISTANT">Using HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant</h2><div>  In case of using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant the following   hints will help to avoid problems:<br> 

<ul>
<li>Some parameters depend on special conditions, e.g., a valid buffer or 
    another parameter activated. After opening the camera these conditions 
    may not yet be fulfilled, so the depending parameters are not shown. 
    By using the 'Refresh' button, all parameters are read again and the 
    depending parameters should appear if the conditions are fulfilled 
    then. 
</li>
<li>There are also some parameters regarding the image size and the payload 
    size, which can only be changed if no acquisition takes place. The 
    safest way to ensure this is to apply the action parameter 
    'do_abort_grab'.  Please note that 'Update Image' has to be disabled 
    first. 
</li>
<li>The behavior of allowing changes to parameters while streaming is 
    active depends on the capabilities of the device. It is possible that 
    some cameras give you control over, e.g., the exposure time, while 
    streaming and others do not.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="USING_COLOR_CONVERSION">Using Internal Color Conversion</h2><div> The HALCON USB3Vision interface supports an internal color conversion performed in software. The conversion is automatically applied for PFNC (Pixel Format Naming Convention) compatible cameras, when the color format delivered by the camera differs from the user defined format if set via the parameter 'color_space'.

</div>
<h2 id="FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</h2><div>The acquisition interface supports the GenICam FWUpdate standard, allowing to update firmware on devices supporting the same standard in a generic way. 
If the device supports the standard, its vendor would distribute the firmware 
update files in form of GUF files, i.e. files with <tt>.guf</tt> extension.<br> 
To apply the firmware update, the device must be opened (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>) 
in a special configuration mode (called "safe mode"). This mode is selected 
through the 'Generic' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> - the parameter must 
include 'device_access=safe-mode'.<br> 
When opened in the safe mode, most of the usual parameters (either those 
provided by HALCON acquisition interface, the device itself or the 
USB3 Vision Producer) will be unavailable. Instead, the configuration 
parameters corresponding to the given device and interface technology and in 
particular the parameters related to firmware update will become available.<br> 
To update the device, the GUF file is first selected in 'fwupdate_file_path', 
one of the (possibly multiple) updates from the file selected using 
'fwupdate_update_selector' and finally applied through 'do_fwupdate_apply'. 
Documentation of these parameters provides further details.<br> 
Note that the update procedure may include one or more device resets, 
after which the device has to be re-discovered by the acquisition interface. 
The time needed for reset and re-discovery is specified by device vendor 
in the GUF file. However, there might be situations (depending on the device 
itself, its connection technology and system setup) when the re-discovery 
timeout is not sufficient and the device fails to get safely re-discovered. 
In such case, it is possible to specify an addtional timeout that would be added 
to the one specified in the GUF file, allowing to successfully complete 
the process. This parameter, 'fwupdate_wait_after_reset', specifies the 
additional timeout in milliseconds.<br>

<td> List of USB3 Vision devices discovered in the system with additional information  as a string. Some values are only shown, if they are available. 
 For misconfigured devices (such as those using no or incorrect driver) 
 a corresponding generic parameter to resolve the problem is suggested.<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>device_id</b> is the name of the device, which will be shown by 
   <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...,'device',...)</tt>. If a user_name (or 
   'DeviceUserID') is set, then this will be shown. Otherwise the unique_name 
   is used. 
</li>
<li><b>unique_name</b> is a string, which contains the device GUID, 
   the vendor and the model separated by underscores. No other device should 
   have the same string, so this is a unique name for the device. 
   If the currently installed drivers don't allow reading the GUID, 
   this string will start with 'TmpNA_'. However, there is a chance that 
   this problem disappears during <a href="#DEVICE_ACCESS">driver assignment</a>. 
</li>
<li><b>user_name</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceUserID', 
   which is a user-defined name for the device. It can be set if the 
   device is opened and provides this feature. 
</li>
<li><b>interface</b> shows the hardware interface by which the device is 
   connected to the PC. For USB3Vision the value of this entry 
   is 'Usan_VirtualIF'. 
</li>
<li><b>producer</b> shows the name of the underlying GenICamTL producer. 
</li>
<li><b>vendor</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceVendorName'. 
</li>
<li><b>model</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceModelName'. 
</li>
<li><b>tl_type</b> shows the type of the underlying transport layer, i.e. 
   'U3V'. 
</li>
<li><b>status</b> shows, if the device is correctly configured or not. The 
   possible values are 'available', 'read-only', 'busy', 'misconfigured' 
   and 'unknown'. For misconfigured devices (such as those with wrong/no 
   attached driver under Windows or insufficient permissions under Linux) 
   a corresponding generic parameter to resolve the problem is suggested 
   through the <b>suggestion</b> info token. 
   Status of 'busy' means the device is currently opened by another application. 
   Even devices that are currently not available for opening are listed. 
</li>
<li><b>suggestion</b> is added only if status is reported as 'misconfigured' 
   because the suitable driver is not attached to the device (Windows) 
   or sufficient permissions are not available for the device's device file. 
   The value of the suggestion info will be the generic 'install_driver' 
   or 'add_permissions' parameter (depending on situation) that can be used to resolve 
   the problem. This means that if you will pass the suggested 
   'install_driver'/'add_permissions' parameter as-is in the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> 
   operator's <tt>Generic</tt> parameter (see its documentation), 
   the USB3Vision interface will attempt to switch the device temporarily 
   to correct subnet and open it.

<td> With the Generic parameter some important values can be set before the  camera is initialized. Note that the parameter names including the values 
 must be strings, e.g., 'num_buffers=5' sets the number of buffers to 5.<br> 
 The following parameters are available:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>num_buffers:</b> 
   To set the maximum number of acquisition buffers used. Note that 
   depending on the image size of the used camera a high number of 
   buffers can exceed the available memory size of your computer. We 
   recommend to use at least 2 buffers. Notice that the interface internally 
   locks 1 buffer (see <a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">acquisition buffer 
   handling</a>), therefore if your application requires n buffers, 
   'num_buffers' must be set to n+1. Default: 4. 
</li>
<li><b>direct_connection:</b> 
   Enables direct connection to the device using its known GenTL interface 
   and device ID. The GenTL specification allows opening the device directly 
   when the device/interface ID is known, without explicitly instructing 
   the GenTL Producer to refresh its internal device list, thus optimizing 
   unnecessary timeouts. 
   Because some GenTL Producers fail to implement this properly, the 
   parameter is disabled by default. Possible values are 'enable' and 
   'disable'. 
</li>
<li><b>install_driver:</b> 
   Request to install the required driver for devices specified by the USB 
   vendor and product ID. The parameter format is 
   'install_driver=vendor_id/product_id', where the vendor_id and product_id 
   are specified as hexadecimal numbers without any prefix. 
   The driver (WinUSB) will be installed to the composite parent of the 
   device(s) matching the vendor and product ID. Note that if another 
   driver was attached before to the device, the applications using that 
   driver will not work any more with the device. 
   When installing the driver, the USB3Vision image acquisition 
   interface will ask for administrator privileges when needed. 
   Note also that when querying the device list using 
   <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'info_boards'...)</tt>, for each device with 
   no driver attached or using an unsupported driver, the USB3Vision 
   will suggest the install_driver generic parameter including vendor 
   and product ID corresponding with the device. When working 
   with the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant, it will directly suggest 
   to apply the generic parameter when connecting to the device. 
   <br>This parameter is applicable on Windows systems only. 
</li>
<li><b>add_permissions:</b> 
   Request to add access permissions for all users to the device file of the 
   device which is specified using the USB bus number and device address. 
   The parameter format is 'add_permissions=bus_number/device_address', where 
   the bus_number and device_address are specified as decimal numbers. 
   The access mode of the device file will be set to 0666 (read and write 
   for everyone).  Note that this has only a temporary effect and will be 
   lost upon system reboot or even upon device reconnection. 
   To achieve a permanent effect, the corresponding udev configuration 
   is required. 
   When changing the permissions, the USB3Vision image acquisition 
   interface will ask for administrative (root) privileges when needed. 
   By default, pkexec will be used to gain root privileges. In situations, 
   when pkexec is not suitable or desired, another command to be used 
   for privilege elevation (such as sudo, gksudo etc.) can be specified 
   through the add_permissions parameter as another optional token. 
   The extended form would be 
   'add_permissions=bus_number/device_address!elevation_command'. 
   A real example thus could be 'add_permissions=5/2!gksudo'. 
   Note also that this will allow specifying the elevation command 
   with full path for increased security. 
   Note also, that when querying the device list using 
   <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'info_boards'...)</tt>, for each device 
   not accessible due to insufficient permissions 
   the USB3Vision image acquisition interface will suggest 
   the add_permissions generic parameter 
   including bus number and device address corresponding to the device. 
   When working with the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant, it will 
   directly suggest to apply the generic parameter when connecting to the 
   device. 
   <br>This parameter is applicable on Linux systems only. 
</li>
<li><b>streaming_mode:</b> 
   In order to disable streaming (grab-related operators), this parameter 
   has to be set to 0. The streaming is by default switched on for 
   devices with streaming support. 
</li>
<li><b>device_event_handling:</b> 
   In order to disable device events which can be useful in case of handling 
   multiple cameras to reduce the used resources like the number of transfers 
   in the Producer, this parameter has to be set to 0. The event handling is 
   by default switched on for devices with event support. 
</li>
<li><b>workarounds:</b> 
   Enables one or more of the workarounds supported by the USB3Vision 
   image acquisition interface. The workarounds are options slightly altering 
   the image acquisition interface behavior in order to cope with some common 
   problems of devices 
   . 
   The individual workaround names might be listed using any separator, for 
   example a space or comma.  Supported workarounds are: 

<ul>
<li><i>enable_range_validation:</i> 
   When this workaround is enabled, an additional check is performed when 
   querying the range of a parameter: check if min <= max &ndash; and an error is 
   returned if the check fails. The invalid range of a GenICam based 
   parameter might be the result of a bug in the corresponding GenICam 
   description file.

 GenICam standard).  A call of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 
 'available_param_names', ...)</tt> returns a tuple containing all available 
 parameters of the connected camera and USB3 Vision Producer. See also

 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(AcqHandle, 'Gain', 6.0)</tt>.<br> 
 Please note that the interface sets the value of a 
 parameter only if the value is valid. Integer and float values not matching 
 the allowed range for given feature are aligned to the closest valid value. 
 Invalid values of other feature types are refused.<br> 
 Additionally to the GenICam parameters of the camera and of the 
 USB3 Vision Producer, the following HALCON interface parameters are

<td>'disable'</td>
<td>string</td>
<td> Controls if the acquisition interface should attempt to append the intensity/color overlay  to the generated 3D object models. Applicable only if a 3D object model is being output 
 from given grab operator. 
 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

<td> Controls if (and how) the information about pixel confidence level is used by the acquisition interface.  Applicable only for devices and use cases where the confidence information is delivered (per-pixel) 
 together with the actual pixel data.<br> 
 The threshold to distinguish between valid and invalid pixels is controlled using the 'confidence_threshold' 
 parameter.<br> 
 Note that in some use cases there might be other criteria how to mark given pixel invalid, for example 
 if the device uses "invalid pixel value" for a 3D coordinate. These cases are not covered by the 
 'confidence_mode' parameter and such invalid pixels are always rejected from the 3D object model.

<ul>
<li><b>off:</b> 
   Default value. The pixel confidence information is not applied to any of the grab operator outputs, 
   even if supplied by the device. 
</li>
<li><b>object_model_3d:</b> 
   If the pixel confidence level information is available, it is applied to the eventually generated 
   3D object models (but not to any other outputs, in particular not to the image outputs). 
   This means that pixels ("points") with confidence lower than the configured threshold are not included

 together with the actual pixel data. 
 The decision how (to which outputs) the confidence threshold is applied is controlled using the 
 'confidence_mode' parameter.<br> 
 The threshold is interpreted as a (float) ratio between 0.0 and 1.0. The acquisition interface 
 will remap this ratio to the actual confidence range provided by the device and use it to decide 
 which pixels are valid and which not. Pixels with confidence lower than the specified threshold

<td>'reference'</td>
<td>string</td>
<td> Controls which coordinate transformation operations should the acquisition interface attempt to  perform when building the 3D object model from acquired 3D coordinates. Note that the decision 
 which transformation should be performed and which parameters should be used fully depends 
 on the 3D configuration information provided by the device together with the acquired data. 
 If this information is insufficient or coordinates are inaccurate, the result of the transformation(s) 
 might be meaningless or unpredictable. 
 Refer to <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a> for more details.<br> 
 Possible values are:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>none:</b> 
   The acquisition interface will not perform any coordinate transformation. The 3D object model 
   will contain the "raw" coordinates, possibly only scaled depending on the hints from the device. 
</li>
<li><b>cartesian:</b> 
   If the coordinate system used by the device is other than Cartesian, the acquisition interface 
   will convert the coordinates to Cartesian system (native for HALCON's 3D object model). 
   It will not attempt to further transform the coordinates from the device's internal ("anchor") 
   coordinate system to the reference system. 
</li>
<li><b>reference:</b> 
   Default mode. 
   Will transform to Cartesian coordinates if needed and then attempt to transform to 
   the "reference" coordinate system if the device supports it and provides corresponding 
   instructions. The purpose of the reference system is to allow merging and aligning data 
   from multiple devices. The reference system is in contrast with the native ("anchor") 
   coordinate system which is device specific and corresponds to its actual measurement 
   system and actual configuration.<br> 
   The position and orientation of the reference system should be indicated 
   by a reference point marker on the device's housing.<br> 
   This always directly implies the transformation to Cartesian coordinates because the reference 
   coordinate system is always Cartesian.

 <b>IMPORTANT:</b> the parameter is disabled by default. When enabling, the application is responsible 
 for releasing the generated object models and associated resources using the clear_object_model_3d

 Supported values are:

   the camera but has no available free buffer to fill it in, the new data 
   is discarded.

<li>'OldestFirstOverwrite': The acquired buffers are always delivered in 
   FIFO manner (oldest first). If the acquisition engine receives a new 
   buffer from the camera but has no available free buffer to fill it in, it 
   checks, whether there are older buffers waiting for delivery, not yet 
   picked up by the consumer. If yes, it takes the oldest of them, 
   overwrites it with the new data and appends it to the end of the output 
   queue. If the output queue is empty (no buffer available for overwriting), 
   the new data is discarded.

<li>'NewestOnly': The output queue of buffers waiting for delivery never 
   contains more than a single (newest) buffer. If the acquisition engine 
   receives a new buffer and there is already an older buffer waiting for 
   delivery in the output queue, the new buffer is put to the output queue 
   instead and the old one is reused for next acquisition. If there are no

<td>string</td>
<td>pre-defined</td>
<td> Controls if the acquisition interface should attempt to append the intensity/color overlay  to the generated 3D object models. Applicable only if a 3D object model is being output 
 from given grab operator. 
 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

 The threshold is interpreted as a (float) ratio between 0.0 and 1.0. The acquisition interface 
 will remap this ratio to the actual confidence range provided by the device and use it to decide 
 which pixels are valid and which not. Pixels with confidence lower than the specified threshold 
 are considered invalid.

 If this information is insufficient or coordinates are inaccurate, the result of the transformation(s)

 Refer to <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a> for more details.<br>

   The acquisition interface will not perform any coordinate transformation. The 3D object model 
   will contain the "raw" coordinates, possibly only scaled depending on the hints from the device. 
</li>
<li><b>cartesian:</b> 
   If the coordinate system used by the device is other than Cartesian, the acquisition interface 
   will convert the coordinates to Cartesian system (native for HALCON's 3D object model). 
   It will not attempt to further transform the coordinates from the device's internal ("anchor") 
   coordinate system to the reference system. 
</li>
<li><b>reference:</b> 
   Default mode. 
   Will transform to Cartesian coordinates if needed and then attempt to transform to 
   the "reference" coordinate system if the device supports it and provides corresponding 
   instructions. The purpose of the reference system is to allow merging and aligning data 
   from multiple devices. The reference system is in contrast with the native ("anchor") 
   coordinate system which is device specific and corresponds to its actual measurement 
   system and actual configuration.<br> 
   The position and orientation of the reference system should be indicated 
   by a reference point marker on the device's housing.<br> 
   This always directly implies the transformation to Cartesian coordinates because the reference 
   coordinate system is always Cartesian.

<h2 id="SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">Operator <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a></h2><div> This interface supports feature change callbacks via the operators  <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> and <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_callback.html">get_framegrabber_callback</a>.<br> 
 The callback can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and USB3 Vision Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 callback targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_callback_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">event data</a> and <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">feature 
 notifications</a> sections. The 'CallbackType' parameter of 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> defines the feature for which the callback is 
 registered. It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">parameter naming convention</a>).<br> 
 The registered callback function would be called whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value.  If the callback function is set to NULL, the 
 corresponding callback will be unregistered.  Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new callback for a feature that already had a callback registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one. 
 <p> 
 The signature of the callback function is 
 <tt>Herror (__stdcall *HAcqCallback)(void *AcqHandle, void *Context, 
    void *UserContext)</tt> and uses the following parameters: 

<ul>
<li><tt>AcqHandle</tt>: 
   Acquisition handle of the corresponding image acquisition instance. 
</li>
<li><tt>Context</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, this 
   parameter is not used, i.e., Context is set to NULL. 
</li>
<li><tt>UserContext</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, 
   this parameter is not used, i.e., UserContext is set to NULL. 
</li>
</ul> 
</p> 
<p> 
Note that the execution time of a user-specific callback function must 
always be as short as possible since during the execution of a callback 
function the handling of further internal callbacks might be blocked. 
This can be achieved by removing the current processing from the 
user-specific callback function to a separate thread that is controlled 
via signals or events. The callback function is executed in the context 
of the underlying interface or driver.

<h2 id="TROUBLESHOOTING">Troubleshooting</h2><div>In case of problems with the HALCON USB3Vision Interface the following hints might help to solve them.<br><br> 
<b>General:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the <a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> 
  of the HALCON USB3Vision interface is used. 
</li>
<li>Check the <a href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</a>. 
</li>
<li>Check if the device has the latest firmware. 
</li>
<li>Enable low-level error messages in HALCON to query more information 
  about the problem (and check the output console in HDevelop if applicable). 
</li>
<li>If your device is connected via Ethernet and 
  a firewall is active in the system, it has to be configured in a way 
  so that all applications expected to be using the GigE Vision devices 
  (e.g. HDevelop, but also any user-developed applications) have full 
  access to the connected devices. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>GenICam:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the correct GenICam binaries are in use. HALCON uses the official 
  binaries in a private installation (folder genicam in the HALCONROOT 
  directory). If other GenICam binaries are in your path or in some system 
  path (for Windows e.g. in c:\Windows\System32\ for Linux e.g. in /usr/lib 
  or similar directories) make sure these are the official ones by comparing 
  them with the ones in the HALCON installation. Using unofficial binaries 
  might result in strange problems. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>If there are still problems, please contact your local distributor.</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
The following information is needed for your support request to avoid 
unnecessary inquiries. 

<ul>
<li>Used HALCON and acquisition interface versions. 
</li>
<li>Used HALCON architecture (especially 32 or 64 bit). 
</li>
<li>Low-level error messages if there are any. 
</li>
<li>Camera manufacturer, model and firmware version. 
</li>
<li>Details about computer system, like operating system, RAM and CPU. 
</li>
<li>Minimal sample code (e.g. HDevelop script) to reproduce the issue. 
</li>
<li>Description of observed and expected behavior. 
</li>

<h2 id="RELEASENOTES">Release Notes</h2><div>
<ul>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.6</b> (Oct 30, 2018): 
<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.1. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
      The Update includes an accelerated MathParser, improved persistence 
      in combination with sequencers and a fix where values were available 
      even though the corresponding feature was not. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's File Access is now supported. See the new parameters 
      'fileaccess_file_path', 'fileaccess_remote_name', 
      'do_fileaccess_download', 'do_fileaccess_upload', 
      'do_fileaccess_delete', and the new HDevelop example 
      usb3vision_fileaccess.hdev. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's FWUpdate is now supported. See 
      <a href="#FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</a> and the new HDevelop example 
      usb3vision_fwupdate.hdev. 
</li>
<li>Receiving GenICam events on message queues is now supported, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
      So far, GenICam events were only supported via callbacks and thus 
      not usable in HDevelop. Additionally, one new HDevelop example has been 
      added to show this functionality usb3vision_acquisition_events.hdev. 
</li>
<li>'do_write_configuration' has been extended to store not only the 
      current device configuration but also generate persistence files 
      for all the USB3 Vision Producer modules 
      (system, interface, device and data stream), see 
      <a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters 'buffer_timestamp_ns' and 
      'device_timestamp_frequency' to improve the usability of 
      'buffer_timestamp' which on its own is unit-agnostic. 
</li>
<li>Some generic parameters passed to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> were not available 
      through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>String parameters longer than 1024 characters were silently cropped by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When 'start_async_after_grab_async' was set 'disable', 
      the acquisition was stopped on the remote device after each frame. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.5</b> (Apr 27, 2018): 

<ul>
<li>The driver installer included in libwdi-usan.dll had a dependency 
      on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'Mono4p' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'YCbCr411_8' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Unsupported pixel formats are now tried to be returned in their actual 
      image dimensions if they are similar enough to a supported Mono format. 
      Before, all unsupported formats were returned as square images (see 
      <a href="#RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format</a>). 
</li>
<li>When 'DeviceUserID' was set to ' ' (a single space), it could not be 
      used to connect.  This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When trying to connect to a busy device using its DeviceUserID, 
      a misleading low-level error appeared. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>On Unix systems, HALCON crashed when ended without calling 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/close_framegrabber.html">close_framegrabber</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Updated underlying libusb version from 1.0.16 to 1.0.21. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.4</b> (Nov 28, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>libusb-1.0-usan.so.0 has been moved to a subdirectory on Linux systems. 
</li>
<li>The technical dependency from the HALCON Library has been removed. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameter 'event_notification_helper' which enables a helper 
      to automatically set 'EventNotification' during 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> if the callback is being registered on an 
      SFNC-compliant event. For further information, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters 'buffer_frameid' and 'image_pixel_format'. 
</li>
<li>When calling <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_callback.html">get_framegrabber_callback</a> on a callback that was not 
      registered, an error was returned. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>With some cameras, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> did not start a new acquisition in 
      'SingleFrame' or 'MultiFrame' mode even though 
      'start_async_after_grab_async' was enabled. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When reaching the 16 bit boundary of the GenCP request ID by 
      numerous changes of camera parameters, one setting failed. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.3</b> (May 3, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0.2 
      which contains some minor bug fixes. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.2</b> (Mar 16, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>Erroneously, the error code H_ERR_FGWR (#5307) 
      was returned in case of incomplete images. 
      This problem has been fixed. Now, the incomplete image is delivered 
      and the parameter 'buffer_is_incomplete' returns true. 
</li>
<li>The system requirements have been updated to <b>libudev.so.1</b> 
      or higher. 
</li>
<li>The interface documentation was extended and now contains 
      a description of the strings returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...,'info_boards',...)</tt>. 
</li>
<li>Added new HDevelop example usb3vision_2cameras.hdev that 
      shows how to use the USB3Vision interface with two cameras. 
</li>
<li>Added new HDevelop example usb3vision_do_abort_grab.hdev that 
      shows how to abort an ongoing image acquisition. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.1</b> (Oct 28, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>HALCON 13 version of the interface. 
</li>
<li>Added support for GenTL 1.5. This mainly means support for 3D data 
      acquisition, see <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>.<br> 
      Therefore, the operators <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> have been implemented, 
      see <a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>.<br> 
      To control the 3D data acquisition, the following parameters have been 
      introduced: image_contents, image_source_id, image_region_id, 
      image_purpose_id, image_raw_buffer_type, image_raw_buffer_padding_bytes, 
      data_contents, data_source_id, data_region_id, data_purpose_id, 
      create_objectmodel3d, coordinate_transform_mode, confidence_mode, 
      confidence_threshold, add_objectmodel3d_overlay_attrib. The integrated 
      producer Usan has been updated to version 
      1.0.7 
      accordingly. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.7</b> (Jul 14, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>Updated integrated producer Usan to version 1.0.6 which introduces 
      more special modes to the parameter 'StreamTransferConfigMode'. 
      These are intended for cameras that are not compatible 
      with Usan's default transfer alignment. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.6</b> (May 13, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0.1. 
      With the previous version some specific cameras could not be opened 
      and in the worst case the application also crashed when using such 
      devices. This problem has been fixed. Please note that therefore also 
      the genicam directory of your HALCON installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Updated integrated producer Usan to version 1.0.5 as it was not 
      possible to use the USB3Vision interface in more than one process 
      at the same time. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Under Windows, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> crashed if the environment variable 
      <tt>PATH</tt> was empty. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.5</b> (Feb 15, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0, 
      which enables to open a device much faster and requires less memory. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'Mono10p' and 'Mono12p' pixel formats. 
</li>
<li>Added limitation for OS X. 
</li>
<li>Added paragraph 'Using internal color conversion' to this document. 
</li>
<li>Updated integrated producer Usan to version 1.0.4. Reaching the full 
      frame rate with small ROI was not possible in combination with a 
      certain CMOSIS sensor. This problem has been fixed. The new parameters 
      'StreamMaxTransferSize' and 'StreamTransferConfigMode' have been 
      introduced to adjust the USB transfers. 
</li>
<li>According to this documentation, the fourth value returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'AnyParameter_range', ...)</tt> 
      was a default value. Actually, it is the current value. 
      Thus, this documentation has been adapted accordingly. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.4</b> (Oct 30, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>The system requirements regarding the Visual Studio C++ 
      Redistributable Package have been updated. 
</li>
<li>The error code H_ERR_FGABORTED (#5336) is returned by the grab 
      operators when a grab has been aborted instead of the former H_ERR_FGF 
      (#5306). 
</li>
<li>In case of devices which do not allow to stop acquisition, e.g. due 
      to a lost connection, the call of the parameter 'do_abort_grab' was 
      not able to abort the running grab. This problem has been fixed. 
      Please note that in this case the communication with the device is 
      somehow broken and re-initialization is strongly advised. 
</li>
<li>The documentation about driver requirements and usage with 
      other interfaces or software has been updated. 
</li>
<li>Added support for user-defined names. 
      Therefore, the strings returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'info_boards'...)</tt> and 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'device'...)</tt> have been extended 
      to include the new entries 
      unique_name:&lt;unique name&gt; and 
      user_name:&lt;user-defined name&gt; which corresponds to UserDeviceID. 
      The content of the new unique_name entry 
      is the same as the content of the former device entry. 
      Now, the device entry contains the user-defined name if available 
      or the unique name. 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> now also accepts user-defined names. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.3</b> (Jun 10, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>Under Windows, some GenICam dynamic libraries were not loaded/unloaded 
      correctly and a low-level error was printed. This problem has been 
      fixed. 
</li>
<li>do_abort_grab returned an error if called before the first grab. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>For 'na' (not available) parameters, neither the range nor the 
      values property was implemented. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Parameters 'grab_timeout' and 'delay_after_stop' were missing the range 
      property. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The access and visibility properties returned 'undefined' in case 
      the parameters had no such properties. Now they return an error 
      if they are not available. 
</li>
<li>'available_param_names' returned not all implemented parameters. Now it 
      also returns 'na' (not available) parameters in addition to 'ro' 
      (readonly), 'wo' (writeonly) and 'rw' (readwrite) parameters, but only 
      when the visibility is not 'invisible'. Note that the access mode of 
      parameters might change during runtime. 
</li>
<li>The documentation of 'num_buffers' was not clear enough about the 
      need of an extra buffer for internal use. The documentation has been 
      improved. 
</li>
<li>Parameters 'buffer_is_incomplete', 'buffer_timestamp', 
      'raw_buffer_padding_bytes', 'raw_buffer_type' had fixed access mode 
      'ro'.  In case no buffer has been grabbed yet this is wrong and should 
      be 'na'. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The HDevelop example usb3vision_parameters.hdev 
      has been improved. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.2</b> (Feb 26, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v2.4.1, 
      including performance improvements and several minor bug fixes. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Updated integrated producer Usan to version 1.0.3. 
</li>
<li>Fixed problems of driver installer under Windows: Win32 was missing 
      files, Win64 needed debug runtime, driver installer was not signed. 
</li>
<li>Addressed limitations of libusbx under Windows to improve usage of 
      multiple cameras. 
</li>
<li>Addressed performance issues in case the camera delivers a higher 
      frame rate as the application can use. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters and documentation for advanced streaming engine 
      control and advanced event engine control. 
</li>
<li>Added GenICam troubleshooting hint. 
</li>
<li>Added support for buffer handling modes 'OldestFirstOverwrite' 
      and 'NewestOnly'. 
</li>
<li>Added generic parameter 'device_event_handling=0' to explicitly 
      ignore the event channel when a device is opened. 
</li>
<li>Made warning about unexpected parameter types more human readable. 
</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with other acquisition interfaces which are 
      using libusbK. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.1</b> (Oct 31, 2014): 

<ul>
<li>HALCON 12 version of the interface. 
</li>
<li>Support more host controllers for driver installation on Windows. 
</li>
<li>Fixed a possible deadlock during initialization on Windows. 
</li>
<li>Fixed documentation of parameter 'camera_type'. The .xml extension 
      option for the configuration file was missing. 
</li>
<li>Improved error information returned by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> when 
      trying to set a parameter without specifying a value. 
</li>
<li>Added missing descriptions of the parameters: 
      'buffer_reallocation_mode', 'do_load_settings' and 'do_write_settings'. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.2</b> (Mar 20, 2014): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem when using multiple image acquisition interfaces, which 
      do not use the same GenApi version, in arbitrary order. 
</li>
<li>Fixed crash when using multiple GenApi-based image acquisition 
      interfaces which use the same GenApi version. In this case, when 
      closing the last instance of one of the interfaces, GenApi could not 
      be used by the remaining interfaces anymore. This fix has the side 
      effect that GenApi cannot be unloaded anymore. 
</li>
<li>Improved description of parameter 'clear_buffer'. 
</li>
<li>Added <b>libudev</b> system requirement for Linux.
