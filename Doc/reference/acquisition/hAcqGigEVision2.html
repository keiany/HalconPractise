<h2 id="GENERAL">General</h2><div>This page provides the documentation of the universal HALCON GigEVision2 interface for accessing all <a href="http://www.gigevision.com/">GigE Vision</a> 
compliant cameras. 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/registration">Registered</a> customers can download the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> of this interface from the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/">MVTec WWW server</a>.<br><br> 
<i>(This GigEVision2 interface replaces the old, deprecated HALCON acquisition GigEVision interface. Users switching from the previous implementation of the GigEVision acquisition interface 
to this new version, GigEVision2, please pay attention to the section highlighting 
<a href="#GEV_1_TO_2">differences between the two interface versions</a> for easy transition).</i>
</div>
<h2 id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>Intel compatible PC with Windows    7 (32-bit or 64-bit) or newer, 
   also WoW64 (using 32-bit HALCON on 64-bit Windows), 
   Linux with kernel 2.6 (or higher) 
   , or macOS. 
</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet network adapter. It is recommended to use a PCIe network 
   adapter which supports <b>Jumbo frames</b>. Please configure the network 
   adapter accordingly, e.g., to a MTU value of 9000, to reduce the amount 
   of interrupts. Furthermore, the camera should be connected directly to 
   the network adapter to avoid interference with other network traffic. 
   Please be aware that networking equipment like switches not necessarily 
   supports Jumbo frames. 
</li>
<li>If you are using a <b>firewall</b> please make sure that your firewall 
   configuration allows your application or HDevelop to connect to the camera 
   and to receive incoming images, otherwise the grabbing will fail. 
   Cameras that support firewall traversal might work anyway. 
</li>
<li><b>MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter under Windows x86, 
   WoW64 or Windows x64:</b> 
   The HALCON GigEVision2 interface automatically 
   uses a filter driver to enhance the performance while streaming images. 
   When installing HALCON 
   the filter driver will be automatically installed, if you enable the 
   corresponding check box during installation.<br> 
   Please make sure that at least the driver version v2.1.8.0 
   is actually installed (check your network properties). Older driver 
   versions will not work! For <b>full functionality</b> you need 
   <b>driver version v2.1.8.1</b>. 
</li>
<li><b>GenICam version 
   3.0.2 
   </b>. The corresponding files are part of the 
   HALCON GigEVision2 package and are located in the directory 
   <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt>. 
</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqGigEVision2.dll</b> or 
   <b>hAcqGigEVision2xl.dll</b>, respectively. If you 
   have properly installed the interface, all these DLLs should reside in 
   <tt>bin\%HALCONARCH%</tt> within the HALCON base directory 
   %HALCONROOT% you have chosen during the installation of HALCON.<br> 
   <b>Linux:</b> HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqGigEVision2.so</b> 
   or <b>hAcqGigEVision2xl.so</b>, respectively. 
   If you have properly installed the interface, the shared objects should 
   reside in <tt>lib\$HALCONARCH</tt> within the HALCON base directory 
   $HALCONROOT you have chosen during the installation of HALCON.<br> 
   <b>macOS:</b> HALCON image acquisition interface 
   <b>hAcqGigEVision2.dylib</b> or <b>hAcqGigEVision2xl.dylib</b>, 
   respectively.  If you have properly installed the interface, the shared 
   objects should reside in the HALCON framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework</tt> or the HALCON XL framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCONxl.framework</tt> in the <tt>Libraries</tt> 
   subdirectory. 
</li>
<li><b>The default acquisition mode assumes the computer is fast enough to 
   process all buffers from the camera. If this is not the case, they are 
   silently discarded.</b>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="ENV_VARS">Environment Variables</h2><div>The interface can be controlled through several environment variables: 
<ul>
<li><tt>HALCON_ACQUIRED_FILE_PAYLOAD_DIR</tt> is used to specify the directory 
  where non-image payload types (usually files or 'raw' data) are stored 
  using the filename given by the 
  device. 
</li>
<li>When specifying a directory with <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_XMLFILE</tt> 
  and/or <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_RAW_XMLFILE</tt>, the GenICam description 
  files (in XML and/or raw format) will be stored there while working with 
  HALCON. These files can also be stored by setting the interface parameter 
  'do_write_configuration'. 
</li>
<li>If you want to use an already installed GenApi version instead of the 
  one supplied with HALCON, you must set the environment variable 
  <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. Additionally, all environment variables 
  which are necessary for GenApi must also be set in this case. This is 
  only for experts, see also section 
  <a href="#GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</a>.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="INSTALLATION">Installation</h2><div>Only when installing or updating the interface manually follow these steps: <br> 

<ul>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory %HALCONROOT% (Note: Administrator privileges may be 
  required for this step). Additionally, you have to move the interface 
  examples to the directory %HALCONEXAMPLES% manually. 
</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory $HALCONROOT. 
</li>
<li><b>OS X:</b> Extract the archive. Manually move the following files: 

<ul>
<li>The .dylib files located in lib/x64-macosx to 
     /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The genicam folder to /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The examples folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Users/Shared/Library/Application Support 
</li>
<li>The doc folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Library/Application Support
</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></div>
<h2 id="LIMITATIONS">Limitations</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>The MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter is available only under Windows.    For more details see paragraph <a href="#FILTERDRIVER">MVTec GigE Vision 
   Streaming Filter</a>. 
</li>
<li>No support of BayerXXPacked, BGRXXPlanar, and RGBXXPlanar pixel formats 
   yet. 
</li>
<li>Only stream channel 0 supported. 
</li>
<li>No support of acquisition from devices with read-only access mode 
</li>
<li>On 32 bit systems, 64 bit parameter values cannot be used. 
</li>
<li>The new SFNC 'Transfer Control' features are currently not considered for 
   acquisition control &ndash; there are currently not enough devices with 
   such functionality on the market.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>This interface uses GenApi version    3.0.2, 
   for more details refer to the <a href="http://www.genicam.org/">GenICam homepage</a>. The 
   corresponding files are part of the HALCON runtime installation and are 
   located in the directory <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base 
   directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt> or <tt>$HALCONROOT</tt>, respectively. 
   This version is the same as the officially released version at the time 
   of writing. 
</li>
<li>The HALCON GigEVision2 interface sets all necessary environment 
   variables on its own and ignores other installed GenICam 
   packages by default.<br> 
   If you want to use another GenICam package, you need to set the 
   environment variable <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. This skips 
   the step of setting all necessary variables and paths internally, so 
   you have to make sure they are set correctly. Please note that it might 
   not be possible to use different GenApi versions with different interfaces 
   at the same time and that you must use the required GenApi version for 
   this interface. 
</li>
<li>The caching of device XML files is activated to speed up processing, 
   Windows uses <tt>%TEMP%</tt> and Linux/macOS use <tt>$TMP</tt> or 
   <tt>/tmp</tt> if <tt>$TMP</tt> is not set for cached XML files.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="GIGE_VISION">GigE Vision</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>This interface implements GigE Vision specification version 2.0, covering    all three basic protocols it defines: control, image/data streaming 
   including chunk data and asynchronous device events. 
</li>
<li>The interface also provides support for the new functionality proposed 
   for (not yet ratified) specification version 2.1, including in particular 
   the multi-part streaming used e.g. by 3D devices. 
</li>
<li>The device features control is accessed via GenApi. 
</li>
<li>To provide a consistent user experience, the control features of the 
   GigE Vision Producer of this interface are also controlled via 
   GenApi.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="DEVICE_ACCESS">GigE Vision Device Access</h2><div> To ensure full access to the device, the following preconditions have to be  fulfilled:<br><br> 
 <b>General:</b> 

<ul>
<li>If a firewall is active in the system, it has to be configured in a way 
   so that all applications expected to be using the GigE Vision devices 
   (e.g. HDevelop, but also any user-developed applications) have full 
   access to the connected devices. 
   Cameras that support firewall traversal might work anyway. 
</li>
<li>If possible, guarantee that the used devices are configured properly 
   to match IP configuration of the network interface they are connected to 
   (either by means of Persistent IP configuration of the device or by means 
   of DHCP). 
</li>
<li>If the device's IP configuration does not match that of the network interface 
   the device is connected to, the HALCON GigEVision2 acquisition 
   interface will discover the device, but will mark it as inaccessible 
   and opening it will not be possible. 
</li>
<li>If you are using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant, it will 
   automatically prompt you to add the correct generic parameter to force 
   a suitable temporary IP address to the device. 
   Please keep in mind that this temporary IP address will not survive 
   the device's power cycle. It is still desirable to configure the device 
   properly (Persistent IP or DHCP) so that it starts with suitable 
   IP configuration upon next power up. 
</li>
</ul> 
 <b>Linux:</b> 

<ul>
<li>On Linux, the discovery of misconfigured (wrong subnet) devices might not 
   be possible if 'reverse path filtering' is switched on in the system. 
   Reverse path filtering is a security option dropping incoming packets on 
   the interface if the reverse path traffic (to the source of the incoming 
   packet) would not be routed on that interface. In practice this means that 
   the discovery packet where the device announces itself would be dropped. 
   To prevent this, we recommend to switch off reverse path filtering option 
   on any interfaces where GigE Vision devices are to be discovered (perhaps 
   unless you are sure that the devices will never be misconfigured). 
   To temporarily disable reverse path filtering on eth0, execute<br> 
   <tt>sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0</tt><br> 
   <tt>sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0</tt><br> 
   To make the changes permanent, adjust these options in the sysctl configuration 
   file (such as /etc/sysctl.conf or /etc/sysctl.d tree):<br> 
   <tt>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0</tt><br> 
   <tt>net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0</tt>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="FILTERDRIVER">MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>For Windows x86 and x64 a so-called 'filter driver' is available. It    is used automatically, if it is installed and activated. This kernel 
   mode driver enhances the performance and should be used if possible. 
</li>
<li><b>Installation:</b><br> 
   When installing HALCON 
   the filter driver will be installed automatically, if you enable the 
   corresponding check box during installation.<br> 
   The filter driver can also be installed separately by the installer in 
   <tt>%HALCONROOT%\misc</tt>.  To do this, close all your network 
   connections and execute the installer as administrator. 
   It will install and enable the filter on all your Ethernet interfaces. 
   The driver files will additionally be placed in 
   <tt>%HALCONROOT%\..\GevStreamingFilter</tt>.<br> 
   To disable the filter for a specific interface, you can deselect the 
   'MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter' in the network interface 
   properties. The filter driver can be uninstalled completely 
   by the uninstaller in <tt>%HALCONROOT%\..\GevStreamingFilter</tt>. 
   To do this, close all your network connections and execute 
   the uninstaller as administrator.<br> 
   Please reboot after the installation of the driver to make sure it 
   can be used. 
</li>
<li><b>Update Installation:</b><br> 
   For updating from an older version of the 'MVTec GigE Vision 
   Streaming Filter', please de-install the old version first before 
   installing the new version (see instructions above). Please reboot to 
   make sure the new version will be used. 
</li>
<li>Note that the filter driver is officially signed with Microsoft 
   Authenticode, but not 
   WHQL-certified, i.e., the installation might warn that the 
   driver is not Windows logo certified. 
   This warning 
   can be safely ignored. 
</li>
<li>The <i>generic parameter</i> <tt>'force_sockdrv'</tt> is available, 
   when it is necessary to disable the use of the filter driver for a specific 
   device. 
</li>
<li>The parameter <tt>'[Stream]GevStreamActiveEngine'</tt> can be queried 
   to check if a specific device uses the filter driver. 
</li>
<li>The filter driver may run out of kernel memory, although there is 
   enough free user memory. Please decrease the <i>generic parameter</i> 
   <tt>'num_buffers'</tt> in this case. 
</li>
<li>If the filter driver cannot be used, the underlying GVSP streaming is 
   performed in user-space by the socket driver which increases the CPU load. 
</li>
<li>When using the MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter some parameters behave 
   different from socket driver as documented.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="MULTIPLE_CAMERAS">Using Multiple Cameras</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>The recommended way of using multiple cameras is to attach each camera    to its own interface. 
</li>
<li>If cameras share a single interface, you need to calculate the resulting 
   load on the link. You can do this roughly, if you multiply the size of 
   one image with the frame rate. This means, e.g., for a VGA gray-scale 
   image with a depth of 8 bit per pixel and a frame rate of 100 
   frames/s:<br> 
   640*480*1 Byte*100/s = 3072000 Byte/s or about 30 MByte/s<br> 
   As a GigE link can transport about 120 MByte/s, theoretically 
   4 cameras can be attached to one link, in practice it might be limited 
   to 3 cameras.  The reason for this smaller number is the overhead for the 
   GVSP protocol and maybe necessary resends, which the above calculation 
   does not take into account. Also depending on the behavior of the camera 
   and the network interface the single packets of the frames (also called 
   blocks) are sent as a burst or equally distributed over a frame time.<br> 
   Additionally, the behavior of the necessary network equipment, like a 
   switch, needs to be taken into account and might result in using small 
   packets and even loss of packets.<br> 
   In such case adjusting network relevant parameters like 
   device's inter-packet delay might be necessary to improve the performance. 
   When in doubts, follow also performance related recommendations 
   of the corresponding device manufacturer.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</h2><div>The connection to the (acquisition) device is established through the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> operator. The operator provides a set of parameters 
allowing to configure the basic properties of the device and how the 
HALCON GigEVision2 interface controls it &ndash; 
see <a href="#OPEN_FRAMEGRABBER">corresponding section</a>. Some of the parameters 
can be also modified at runtime through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>. 
This section concentrates solely on the 'Device' parameter 
of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, identifying the device (usually camera) 
that should be opened.<br> 
A connection to the device accessible through the GigEVision2 
interface is established using the device ID which is guaranteed to be 
unique per GigE Vision device and (usually) stays persistent 
across multiple sessions. Optionally, the connection can be further defined 
through the interface ID, defining a single network interface of the host 
to be used for device lookup. Finally, instead of the unique device ID, 
the user-defined name attached to the device can be used. 
The list of all devices currently available in the system can be at any 
point obtained using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> parameter 'device' or 'info_boards' &ndash; 
see <a href="#INFO_FRAMEGRABBER">corresponding section</a>. Both parameters 
return a list of devices, each specified using the above listed entities in the format 
<tt>' | device:&lt;device id&gt; | ... | interface:&lt;interface id&gt; | ...  '</tt>, 
where <tt>'&lt;device id&gt;'</tt> 
is either the unique device ID or a user-defined name ('DeviceUserID'). 
If a user-defined name is set on the device, the string obtained by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> 
will contain the entry <tt>'user_name:&lt;user-defined name&gt;'</tt>. 
To make it easier for the user, the <tt>'device'</tt> entry reflects 
the user-defined name if it is unique. If the same user-defined name 
is assigned to more than one device, only the first one will use it, 
all others will use the unique name instead. 
The full string (obtained from the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> call) can be directly used 
for the 'Device' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, it uses the same format. 
Only the <tt>' | device:&lt;device id&gt;'</tt> string entry is mandatory for <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, 
the others might be omitted. <br><br> 
If you know the device ID in advance, you can create the string yourself 
&ndash; without using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a>. As shown above, it consists of entries 
separated by ' | ', the <tt>'device'</tt> entry being the only significant one. 
The optional <tt>'interface'</tt> entry specifies the network interface to look 
for the device.<br> 
When a string without any ' | ' separator is used, it is interpreted directly 
as the device ID.<br> 
As a special case, the string 'default' can be used &ndash; in this case the HALCON 
acquisition interface will use the first available device (devices currently reported 
as non-accessible will be skipped). Note that when using 
the same 'default' string again, that device will no more be accessible, therefore the 
next accessible device will be opened. This way, all devices connected to the system 
may be easily opened in a loop. 
<p><i> 
Note that the current version of the interface supports only single-stream devices 
and the first available stream is always open. If support for devices 
with multiple image streams will be added in future, the format to open 
the device might be extended with the stream entry. 
</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</h2><div>The features of a device or GigE Vision Producer are described by GenICam feature description files (XML files) that are automatically parsed 
and offered to the user. The HALCON GigEVision2 image acquisition interface 
provides access to the features exposed through the following GenICam feature 
description files: 

<ul>
<li>Features of the connected device 
  ("remote device"), 
  typically a camera, are usually loaded directly from the connected device. 
</li>
<li>Features of the GigE Vision Producer are exposed through 
  a set of GenICam description files, one for each internal entity to control 
  the device tree: 

<ul>
<li>The "system" &ndash; representing the overall behavior of the acquisition 
     interface 
</li>
<li>The interface used to connect the device to the system. 
</li>
<li>A proxy (called "local device") to the device, controlling the 
     GigE Vision Producer view of the device. 
</li>
<li>The data stream used for the acquisition (if the device provides any 
     data streams). 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul> 
In most cases the GenICam description files are provided by the device and 
the GigE Vision Producer. It is possible to store a copy of these 
files corresponding to an open connection by using the parameter 
<tt>'do_write_configuration'</tt> (see <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>). 
The command will write all the GenICam 
description files and an "ini" file (details in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) with 
various information, including the location of the written GenICam 
description files, in the following format: 
<pre> 
RemoteFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE% 
SystemFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfaceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DeviceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_LOCAL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
The same ini-file format can be reused to force the HALCON acquisition 
interface to load an alternative XML file for one or more of these entities. 
This can be useful, e.g., for updates or troubleshooting. 
The files listed in the ini file will be used for the given entity instead of 
the original ones. For the entities excluded from the ini file, the GenICam 
description file will be searched and loaded the usual way. To apply the ini 
file, pass its full path to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> in the 'CameraType' 
parameter.<br><br> 
Note that the ini-file can be reused also for other purposes such as 
storing/restoring configuration as described in 
<a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</h2><div>The following groups of parameters exist: 
<ul>
<li>Internal parameters of the HALCON GigEVision2 image acquisition 
  interface itself. These are named following the "underscore" naming 
  style, e.g., <tt>color_space</tt>, and are all lowercase. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the 
  device, usually a camera, use by 
  convention the "CamelCase" style, e.g., <tt>ExposureTime</tt>. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the individual GigE Vision Producer 
  modules (system, interface, device and data stream) use by convention 
  the same style but are prefixed with the module name in square brackets. 
  Beware that the system and interface modules might potentially be shared by 
  multiple opened devices, so changing their configuration might have side 
  effects on other connections as well. The following prefixes are used: 

<ul>
<li>"[System]", e.g., <tt>[System]TLVendorName</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Interface]", e.g., <tt>[Interface]InterfaceType</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Device]", e.g., <tt>[Device]DeviceID</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Stream]", e.g., <tt>[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode</tt>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</h2><div>The parameters belonging to the system and interface modules of the GigE Vision Producer (ie. those with "[System]" and "[Interface]" prefix see 
<a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a> ) must be treated in a special way.<br> 
To grasp their behavior, it is important to understand that they do not describe 
or configure the device itself and do not thus fully belong to the opened instance of the device.<br> 
The interface module parameters belong to the interface on which given device was discovered 
and is shared among all devices open under this interface (see also 
<a href="#OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</a>). 
The system module parameters belong to the entire GigE Vision Producer and are shared 
among all devices open within this GigE Vision Producer.<br> 
This has several implications. In particular, when accessing the system or interface module parameters 
through multiple device instances, those parameters must be treated as shared resources. 
Modifying those parameters through one device instance affects their values (and possibly values 
of other features depending on them) as seen through other device instances. Initial values of those 
parameters after opening a device instance might depend on the interactions with these features 
from previously opened device instances.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_TYPES">Parameters &ndash; GenICam Data Types</h2><div>HALCON native parameter types are 
<ul>
<li><tt>integer</tt> &ndash; signed integer, 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, 32-bit on 
  32-bit ones 
</li>
<li><tt>real</tt> &ndash; floating point type 
</li>
<li><tt>string</tt> &ndash; classical string 
</li>
</ul> 
When accessing GenICam-based features, the GenICam data types must be mapped 
to the parameter types recognized by HALCON. GenICam offers the following 
types: 

<ul>
<li><tt>IInteger</tt> &ndash; integer value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>real</tt> 
  parameters and when the GenICam feature in question is identified to be an 
  IP or MAC address, the string representation of the address will also be 
  accepted.  It should be highlighted that a problem can occur when running 
  HALCON on a 32-bit platform (where <tt>integer</tt> parameters are 32-bit 
  wide) and accessing a GenICam feature that is naturally 64-bit. In such 
  cases the full range of the feature will not be available to the 
  application and its value might be truncated. Also the sign of the 
  parameter might be misinterpreted. To solve this problem, the parameter 
  'split_param_values_into_dwords' can be used. This maps the 64-bit IInteger 
  value into two 32-bit integer values and vice versa. 
</li>
<li><tt>IFloat</tt> &ndash; floating point value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>real</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameters. 
</li>
<li><tt>IString</tt> &ndash; string value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type. 
</li>
<li><tt>IBoolean</tt> &ndash; boolean type is handled through HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameters, a value of 0 (zero) means logical false, other 
  values mean logical true. 
</li>
<li><tt>IEnumeration</tt> &ndash; enumeration is a type that allows selecting from 
  a set of values that are primarily identified by their name (the values are 
  called 'enum entries'). Enumerations are interfaced through HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type, while the enum entry names are used as the 
  parameter values. 
</li>
<li><tt>ICommand</tt> &ndash; The command type allows to "execute" actions. To 
  execute a command, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> with an <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameter of any value (the value is ignored). Some commands' execution 
  might take longer time and the command provides feedback when it is done. 
  To query the status, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> for that command. It will 
  return an <tt>integer</tt> value of 1 if it "is done" (command execution 
  has finished), 0 if it has not finished yet.  Note that if some other features 
  are designed to be dependent on the command, querying the "is done" status 
  might be essential to get the depending features invalidated (and updated 
  with new values) as soon as the command execution finishes. 
</li>
<li><tt>IRegister</tt> &ndash; The register data type is used for plain memory blobs 
  that cannot be mapped to any other data type. They are interfaced through 
  HALCON's <tt>string</tt> parameter type, the register value is the 
  hexadecimal string representation of the register's memory.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</h2><div>The current status of the device settings (values of all the parameters defining its working state) might be persisted while no acquisition 
is active, i.e. before <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> or after 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', 1)</tt>. 
The persistence functionality consists of two steps, storing the current configuration 
to a file and later re-loading it back to the device. 
The current device settings can be stored using the 'do_write_settings' parameter 
and re-loaded later using the 'do_load_settings' parameter, specifying the desired 
persistence file path in both cases.<br><br> 
Note that while the format of the file is intentionally human readable and the file 
can be hand-modified if desired, such modifications should be done with care 
by someone familiar with the GenICam persistence functionality internals and given 
device. Improper modifications of the file can lead to errors when using it.<br><br> 
It is important to know that while performed by the software, the feature settings 
persistence is actually a camera-side function. If the persistence support is implemented 
incorrectly or incompletely by the device, it will not work as expected &ndash; in such 
a case the camera manufacturer could provide additional information or help.<br><br> 
The same persistence file can be applied to the entire set of devices of the same type 
and firmware version. Applying the persistence file to a device of another type 
or using even different firmware version will probably lead to inconsistencies 
or will even fail completely &ndash; the corresponding device manufacturer should provide 
guidelines for such use cases.<br><br> 
Apart from the 'do_write_settings', the feature persistence file will also be written 
together with the ini file documented in the section 
<a href="#XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</a> - using parameter 
'do_write_configuration'. This command 
will also generate persistence files for all the GigE Vision Producer modules 
(system, interface, device and data stream). 
The persistence file entries in the ini file 
will have the format 
<pre> 
RemotePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE%</tt> 
SystemPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfacePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DevicePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_LOCAL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
If the persistence functionality is not supported properly (or at all) by a given 
device, use the GenICam features UserSetSave/UserSetLoad, if supported by the device. 
These features will allow to store/load the device settings in the device's 
non-volatile memory.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OVERVIEW">Acquisition &ndash; Overview, Device Control</h2><div>The image acquisition can be either synchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>) or asynchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>), 
see the reference documentation of the operators.<br> 
The interface fully configures and controls the acquisition process on the 
camera. 
Note that some of the camera 
features might be locked by GenICam when an acquisition is active.<br> 
With synchronous grab (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>), a new acquisition is started 
internally for each image, so that the application always gets a new image. 
Before delivering the image, the acquisition is stopped again, so between 
individual <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a> calls, all acquisition related features 
remain unlocked.<br> 
With asynchronous grabbing, started explicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or 
implicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>, the interface keeps the 
acquisition running internally, collecting further images to be delivered 
through future <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> calls. The acquisition related 
features are locked, until the acquisition is stopped using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.<br> 
Note that the interface properly recognizes the 'Continuous', 'SingleFrame' 
and 'MultiFrame' acquisition modes configured on the device and adjusts the 
acquisition control logic accordingly.<br> 
Note that the HALCON acquisition interface itself takes over exclusive access 
to several remote device features essential for the acquisition control 
(AcquisitionStart, AcquisitionStop, AcquisitionAbort, TLParamsLocked). The 
user application has no direct way to control these features.<br> 
The differences between the "image" and "data" version of the grab operators 
is documented in 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</h2><div>The interface allocates 4 buffers for the acquisition engine by default (the number of buffers can be changed through the 'Generic' parameter of 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>).<br> 
Whenever a new image is acquired successfully and passed to the application 
as a HALCON image, the interface keeps the buffer locked (not returning it to 
the acquisition engine) until a new grab-related operator is called by the 
application or the acquisition is aborted using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.  During this 
period, it is fully safe to query information about this "last acquired" 
buffer &ndash; for example query buffer properties through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> 
parameters such as 'buffer_timestamp', 'buffer_is_incomplete', 
'image_width' and 'image_height'. This applies also to 
<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a> 
eventually present in the buffer and is also usable in volatile 
mode.<br> 
When a new grab-related operator is called by the application, the interface 
returns the buffer to the acquisition engine and buffer-related queries are 
not valid anymore. 
<br><br> 
It can happen, that the camera is temporarily or constantly acquiring data 
in higher speed than the application is processing them. In such case the 
streaming engine of the GigE Vision Producer decides how to treat 
the acquired buffers based on the '[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode' 
parameter. 
<br><br> 
Note that the streaming engine behavior can be further controlled through 
additional parameters described in

<h2 id="ACQUISITION_IMAGE_FORMAT">Acquisition &ndash; Image Format Handling</h2><div>With modern, generic image acquisition interfaces an application cannot make valid assumptions about the image format coming from the device based on the 
current settings. Some devices for example allow changing the image format 
properties while the acquisition is active. 
<br> 
The HALCON GigEVision2 image acquisition interface fully supports these 
use cases.  It checks the image format and other important properties of 
every single buffer and generates HALCON images corresponding to both the 
acquired image format and eventual user configured output format parameters 
such as 'color_space' and 'bits_per_channel'. Only if the necessary 
information about the buffer are missing 
, the current settings are used as a fallback.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</h2><div>The acquisition interface provides two mechanisms for acquisition of the image (or other) data from the device, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> and 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>. Each of them might be more suitable for different 
use cases. Internally, both mechanisms work exactly the same (in particular 
how they acquire and process the data from the device), they differ in the way 
how the outputs are provided to the application.<br> 
The "traditional" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators are still well suitable 
in simple use cases when just a single 2D image is acquired from the device. 
It is also currently used e.g. by the HDevelop's Image Acquisition Assistant. 
However, in case when the device is streaming more complex data structures, 
such as 3D data, multi-AOI or similar data, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> 
is not able to provide all the outputs. In all these cases it will simply 
provide the first image found in the acquired data.<br> 
The "extended" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators allow to output arbitrary 
number of HALCON images and also arbitrary number of control data. It is therefore 
suitable for use in advanced use cases when more than just a single HALCON image 
should be output. An important use case is acquisition from 3D devices 
(<a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>) when the operators can build and output 
the 3D object model through the control data output. It can be also used 
in other (possibly even device-specific) situations when the device outputs 
multiple images for a single acquisition.<br> 
The structure of the provided outputs can be queried with help of the 
'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.<br> 
The <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> can also be used in the simple single-image 
use cases - in that case they will simply provide a single HALCON image 
and zero control data outputs. They can thus be used as full replacement 
of the traditional <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators.
</div>
<h2 id="USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</h2><div>The acquisition interface fully supports the GenICam standard 3D device model and is thus capable to seamlessly integrate 3D devices compliant with this 
model. This means in particular that the application does not need to care 
about device-specific ways of 3D data formatting, the acquisition interface 
will generate the 3D data under the hood using the information from the device.<br> 
If instructed so (using the 'create_objectmodel3d' parameter), the acquisition 
interface will generate the 3D object model from the coordinate data acquired 
from the device. This model can be directly used by the HALCON's 3D object model 
related operators.<br> 
The completeness and accuracy of the final 3D object model strongly depends 
on the actual coordinate data and in particular on the 3D configuration information 
provided by the device. Because the 3D configuration metadata are typically passed 
from the device through the chunk data mechanism 
(<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a>), it is essential to observe that 
the chunk data generation is fully enabled on the device.<br> 
If some of the important 3D configuration information is missing, the acquisition 
interface will try to use the suitable defaults, but the quality of the 3D object 
model output can be lowered.<br> 
The creation of the 3D object model can be further affected by additional parameters 
such as 'coordinate_transform_mode', 'confidence_mode', 'confidence_threshold', 
'add_objectmodel3d_overlay_attrib'.<br> 
Note: for devices not complying with the GenICam standard 3D device model 
the HALCON 3D object model cannot be automatically generated.<br> 
Note that the 3D object model output is only supported by the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> 
operators, it cannot be acquired using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>. Besides the 
3D object model, the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators also output the actual 
raw coordinate data in form of HALCON images. The individual outputs can be identified 
with help of 'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format &ndash; Custom Pixel Formats, Non-image Buffers</h2><div>The HALCON GigEVision2 image acquisition interface has a built-in converter from the pixel formats described in the GenICam Standard Features Naming 
Convention to the desired HALCON image format. The parameters ColorSpace 
and BitsPerChannel (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, eventually <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) 
define the desired format of the resulting HALCON image.  If these parameters 
are set to defaults, the original pixel format coming from the device is 
preserved.<br> 
To offer a basic support of custom pixel formats (i.e., pixel formats not 
defined by PFNC or not supported by HALCON), the ColorSpace value 'raw' can 
be used. In this case the image acquisition interface delivers the buffer to the 
application without any format conversions.<br> 
Note that the same principle is applied whenever a buffer containing other 
than image data is acquired. Examples of such buffers can be files (e.g., 
compressed images) or raw data (results of smart camera processing). Such 
buffers are not real "images", but can still be delivered to the application 
as 'raw' HALCON images. It is the responsibility of the application to know 
how to interpret such data.<br> 
Last but not least, the 'raw' color space can also be used if the user explicitly wishes 
to receive raw input data without any conversions. For example when 
acquiring Bayer encoded images, specifying 'raw' means that the interface 
should not attempt to decode them to RGB or monochrome format, but deliver 
the data directly to the application.<br> 
It is important to know that when the interface does not have full information 
about the image format (dimensions and pixel format), it has to choose an 
artificial one.  In such a case it delivers always an 8-bit image with 
dimensions matching the buffer size (square root of the image size). 
Eventually an unused tail of the HALCON image (if such an artificial image is 
bigger than the source buffer) will be padded with zeroes.  The fact whether 
the last acquired buffer contained an image of known properties or a blob of 
other data (so that the artificial HALCON image size had to be used) as well 
as the size of the eventual tail padding can be queried using 
'raw_buffer_type' and 'raw_buffer_padding_bytes' parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible cameras can deliver additional meta-data with every image in a so-called chunk data format. It is usually necessary to enable 
the delivery of individual meta-data "chunks" using the features 
'ChunkModeActive' and 'ChunkSelector'/'ChunkEnable' first.<br> 
The decoding of the chunk data and matching them to the corresponding camera 
features is performed transparently by the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism, i.e., <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. The choice of the meta-data to be 
delivered is device-specific. The names of the chunk related features usually 
start by convention with a prefix 'Chunk' (examples might be 
'ChunkExposureTime' or 'ChunkGain'), however, the camera documentation should 
contain all the information about supported chunks and their corresponding 
feature names.<br> 
It is important to remember, that the chunk data related features will 
provide only meaningful values if the "last acquired buffer" is valid, i.e., 
between delivery of the last image and next call to any grab-related operator 
(refer to section 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</a>).
</div>
<h2 id="FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</h2><div>It is possible to receive notifications about changes of any features exposed through the GenICam interface by the camera and GigE Vision Producer.<br> 
Note that the notifications might be raised in various circumstances, 
including: 

<ul>
<li>The application (you) explicitly changed that feature. 
</li>
<li>Another feature has changed and the notified feature "depends" on the 
  changed feature (the dependencies are defined in the GenICam description 
  file). 
</li>
<li>Access mode or current range for the feature has changed. 
</li>
<li>As a result of regular "polling" in case of uncached features. 
</li>
<li>As a result of device event delivery if the feature is connected to that 
  event. 
</li>
<li>As a result of new buffer delivery for features corresponding to chunk 
  data. 
</li>
</ul> 
Note that the notifications are raised whenever the feature is "marked dirty" 
(its cache invalidated) by one of the actions described above. It does not 
necessarily mean that its value has really changed, it is up to the 
application to check this.<br> 
Notification callbacks can be registered for individual features using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> - see <a href="#SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">corresponding 
operator documentation</a>. Additionally, it is possible to use 
message queues to receive the event notification. In those cases it is necessary 
to create a message queue and then register the individual feature - see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">event message queues</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_DATA">Event Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible devices can deliver asynchronous events which optionally carry additional data. It is usually necessary to enable delivery 
of individual event types using the features 
'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' first. 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The decoding of the event data and matching them to the corresponding 
features, including potential notifications, is performed transparently by 
the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism like <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> or by get_message_tuple if you are 
using message queues to receive events. The choice of the event types to be 
generated is device-specific.  The names of the event related features 
usually start by convention with a prefix 'Event' (examples might be 
'EventFrameTrigger' and 'EventFrameTriggerTimestamp'), however, the device 
documentation should contain all the information about supported events and 
their corresponding feature names.<br> 
Although the data corresponding to the last delivered event can be in general 
read at any time, when using callback to receive events it is highly recommended 
that reading the event data is synchronized to notifications for corresponding 
event feature(s). Only in such a case it is guaranteed that the read data correspond 
exactly to the very event instance being notified &ndash; and that the feature 
values are not just being modified through a new instance of the same event. 
Note that the notifications are raised from context of the event handling/dispatching 
thread, so when processing the user callback, the event handling mechanism is 
paused. If multiple data items are associated with the same event, it is 
enough to register notification just for the actual event feature and read 
all the data during the callback.<br> 
If using message queues to receive events, you can decide to add additional data 
to be delivered with the corresponding event feature(s), see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
For this case the interface will read all the specified event features 
as soon as the event is generated and add it to the corresponding message. 
This guarantees that the delivered information corresponds with the actual 
value at the time the event was generated.<br> 
Besides the asynchronous events generated by the actual device, asynchronous 
events (optionally including additional data) can be generated by any 
module of the GigE Vision Producer (system, interface, device 
and data stream). The information provided above about handling of the device 
events applies similarly also to the GigE Vision Producer events, 
including enabling/disabling them (typically using 'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' 
features provided by given module, i.e. with corresponding module prefix 
in the feature name). 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The interface will automatically capture and decode the events and match them 
to the corresponding GigE Vision Producer features. It is only important 
to understand that because the system and interface modules are potentially 
shared among multiple opened devices 
(see <a href="#PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</a>) and so, 
the same applies for asynchronous events generated by these shared modules.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</h2><div> This interface supports feature change notifications via message queues.  Select the desired target feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_selector', ...)</tt>. 
 It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a>).<br> 
 Create a message queue at which you want to receive the notifications with 
 <tt>create_message_queue</tt> and assign it to the selected feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', QueueHandle)</tt>.<br> 
 The message queue can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and GigE Vision Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_event_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a> and 
 <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</a> sections.<br> 
 A new message would be added to the specified queue whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value. 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', 0)</tt> 
 unregisters the previously registered message queue from the specified event. 
 Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new message queue for a feature that already had a message queue registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one.<br> 
 The messages incoming on an event can be retrieved with 
 <tt>dequeue_message</tt> and will contain at least three tuples. 
 The first tuple (key 'id') is a unique identifier of the acquisition 
 instance the event is coming from. It is a string composed as 
 '&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;'. The second tuple (key 'event_name') 
 is the name of the corresponding feature previously specified by 
 'event_selector'. The third tuple (key 'event_value') contains the value 
 if the corresponding feature if available. 
 If you decide to add additional data to be delivered with the 
 corresponding event feature(s), add the features of interest with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_data', ...)</tt>. 
 Each event data feature will be appended to the event message 
 with the key being its name and the tuple its value if available.
</div>
<h2 id="ADVANCED_STREAM_CONTROL">Advanced Streaming Engine Control</h2><div>The streaming engine attempts to work well for all standard use cases. However, to reach optimal performance (whatever that means from perspective 
of each application), fine-tuning some parameters might be desirable 
to match given device type and application needs. 
One important aspect of the GigE Vision streaming protocol is management 
of resend-requests for missing packets (which can get lost between the device 
and application due to various reasons including in particular high CPU load). 
The control of the resend-requests might need to be considered both from application 
perspective (preferring low latency and high throughput or high reliability) 
as well as from device perspective (fixed predictable packet/block timing 
versus irregular streaming expectable eg. for line scan cameras). 
It is desirable that based on known characteristics of the device and the system 
the resend requests are neither issued too late (the device might no longer 
store copies of those packets) nor too early (which can lead to duplicate 
packets being sent).<br> 
The engine can therefore be configured through various stream parameters 
including '[Stream]GevStreamMaxPacketGaps', '[Stream]GevStreamMaxBlockDuration', 
or '[Stream]GevStreamDeliverIncompleteBlocks'. 
When changing a parameter, it will be passed to the packet handling engine 
at closest suitable point (typically when re-queueing a buffer back to the engine) 
and applied to subsequent buffer acquisitions.<br> 
On the other hand, the engine provides various statictics that might help 
to observe its performance and behavior and help to fine tune the input 
parameters. The statistics include for example '[Stream]GevStreamLostPacketCount', 
'[Stream]GevStreamResendCommandCount', or '[Stream]GevStreamIncompleteBlockCount'. 
The statistics are updated regularly and reset on each acquisition start.<br> 
Refer to the documentation of the stream parameters for complete list 
and details.<br> 
If the stream filter driver is not used, the ability to process incoming data 
has a heavy effect on the performance of the streaming engine. This is strongly 
affected by the priority of the streaming engine thread relative to 
other threads in the system. Refer to the documentation of the 
parameters '[Stream]StreamThreadPriority', 
'[Stream]StreamThreadSchedulingPolicy' and 
'[Stream]StreamThreadApplyPriority' for details. Upon device open, 
generally suitable default priority is selected.<br> 
Finally, the streaming infrastructure can be completely disabled 
using the 'streaming_mode=0' generic parameter while opening the 
device.
</div>
<h2 id="ADVANCED_EVENT_CONTROL">Advanced Event Engine Control</h2><div>The event engine works well for standard use cases. However, in specific use cases, the behavior must be fine tuned. The parameters 
described in this section are intended for this advanced use only 
and should be treated with care - wrong configuration can 
significantly affect performance.<br> 
The event engine thread priority is controlled by the parameters 
'[Device]DeviceEventsThreadPriority', 
'[Device]DeviceEventsThreadSchedulingPolicy' 
and '[Device]DeviceEventsThreadApplyPriority'. 
Upon device open, generally suitable default priority is selected.<br> 
The event handling infrastructure can be completely disabled 
using the 'device_event_handling=0' generic parameter while opening 
the device.
</div>
<h2 id="GEV_DEBUGGING">Debugging GigE Vision Applications</h2><div>When debugging applications using GigE Vision devices, it is important to know that a core concept of the GigE Vision protocol is maintaining 
connection with the device using the regular 'heartbeat' packets. 
When the application stops maintaining the heartbeat, the device 
disconnects. The HALCON GigEVision2 handles the heartbeat 
control fully transparently, but there is a specific case when 
it cannot do so - when the application is being debugged and hits 
a breakpoint. In such case all threads are typically halted, including 
the one responsible for heartbeat maintenance.<br> 
To prevent loosing connection to the device while debugging, it is possible 
to significantly prolong the heartbeat timeout period or fully disable 
the heartbeat control on the device. Learn details from description 
of the parameters '[Device]DeviceLinkHeartbeatTimeout' 
and '[Device]DeviceLinkHeartbeatMode'.
</div>
<h2 id="USING_HDEVELOP_IMAGE_ACQUISITION_ASSISTANT">Using HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant</h2><div>  In case of using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant the following   hints will help to avoid problems:<br> 

<ul>
<li>Some parameters depend on special conditions, e.g., a valid buffer or 
    another parameter activated. After opening the camera these conditions 
    may not yet be fulfilled, so the depending parameters are not shown. 
    By using the 'Refresh' button, all parameters are read again and the 
    depending parameters should appear if the conditions are fulfilled 
    then. 
</li>
<li>There are also some parameters regarding the image size and the payload 
    size, which can only be changed if no acquisition takes place. The 
    safest way to ensure this is to apply the action parameter 
    'do_abort_grab'.  Please note that 'Update Image' has to be disabled 
    first. 
</li>
<li>The behavior of allowing changes to parameters while streaming is 
    active depends on the capabilities of the device. It is possible that 
    some cameras give you control over, e.g., the exposure time, while 
    streaming and others do not.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="USING_COLOR_CONVERSION">Using Internal Color Conversion</h2><div> The HALCON GigEVision2 interface supports an internal color conversion performed in software. The conversion is automatically applied for PFNC (Pixel Format Naming Convention) compatible cameras, when the color format delivered by the camera differs from the user defined format if set via the parameter 'color_space'. The used transformation algorithms are basic and optimized for speed.<br>  <p> 
 Following transformations from the camera color space (see also PFNC) to the interface color space (see also 'color_space' parameter in this document) are supported:<br>

</div>
<h2 id="FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</h2><div>The acquisition interface supports the GenICam FWUpdate standard, allowing to update firmware on devices supporting the same standard in a generic way. 
If the device supports the standard, its vendor would distribute the firmware 
update files in form of GUF files, i.e. files with <tt>.guf</tt> extension.<br> 
To apply the firmware update, the device must be opened (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>) 
in a special configuration mode (called "safe mode"). This mode is selected 
through the 'Generic' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> - the parameter must 
include 'device_access=safe-mode'.<br> 
When opened in the safe mode, most of the usual parameters (either those 
provided by HALCON acquisition interface, the device itself or the 
GigE Vision Producer) will be unavailable. Instead, the configuration 
parameters corresponding to the given device and interface technology and in 
particular the parameters related to firmware update will become available.<br> 
To update the device, the GUF file is first selected in 'fwupdate_file_path', 
one of the (possibly multiple) updates from the file selected using 
'fwupdate_update_selector' and finally applied through 'do_fwupdate_apply'. 
Documentation of these parameters provides further details.<br> 
Note that the update procedure may include one or more device resets, 
after which the device has to be re-discovered by the acquisition interface. 
The time needed for reset and re-discovery is specified by device vendor 
in the GUF file. However, there might be situations (depending on the device 
itself, its connection technology and system setup) when the re-discovery 
timeout is not sufficient and the device fails to get safely re-discovered. 
In such case, it is possible to specify an addtional timeout that would be added 
to the one specified in the GUF file, allowing to successfully complete 
the process. This parameter, 'fwupdate_wait_after_reset', specifies the 
additional timeout in milliseconds.<br>

<td> List of GigE Vision devices discovered in the system with additional information  as a string. Some values are only shown, if they are available. 
 For misconfigured devices (such as those having an IP of a wrong subnet) 
 a corresponding generic parameter to resolve the problem is suggested.<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>device_id</b> is the name of the device, which will be shown by 
   <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...,'device',...)</tt>. If a user_name (or 
   'DeviceUserID') is set, then this will be shown. Otherwise the unique_name 
   is used. 
</li>
<li><b>unique_name</b> is a string, which contains the device MAC address, 
   the vendor and the model separated by underscores. No other device should 
   have the same string, so this is a unique name for the device. 
</li>
<li><b>user_name</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceUserID', 
   which is a user-defined name for the device. It can be set if the 
   device is opened and provides this feature. 
</li>
<li><b>interface</b> shows the hardware interface by which the device is 
   connected to the PC. For GigEVision2 the value of this entry 
   is 'Esen_ITF_' with the MAC address, IP and subnet mask of the the 
   network interface card appended. 
</li>
<li><b>producer</b> shows the name of the underlying GenICamTL producer. 
</li>
<li><b>vendor</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceVendorName'. 
</li>
<li><b>model</b> represents the value of the feature 'DeviceModelName'. 
</li>
<li><b>tl_type</b> shows the type of the underlying transport layer, i.e. 
   'U3V'. 
</li>
<li><b>device_ip</b> shows the IP address of the device, e.g. 169.54.12.243/16. 
   This value can also be queried by the feature 'GevCurrentIPAddress'. 
</li>
<li><b>interface_ip</b> is the IP address of the interface (mostly a network card), 
   which has detected the device by a broadcast request, e.g. 169.54.18.34/16. 
</li>
<li><b>status</b> shows, if the device is correctly configured or not. The 
   possible values are 'available', 'read-only', 'busy', 'misconfigured' 
   and 'unknown'. For misconfigured devices (such as those with IP settings 
   for incorrect subnet) a corresponding generic parameter to resolve 
   the problem is suggested through the <b>suggestion</b> info token. 
   Status of 'busy' means the device is currently opened by another application. 
   Even devices that are currently not available for opening are listed. 
</li>
<li><b>suggestion</b> is added only if status is reported as 'misconfigured' 
   because the device is on wrong subnet. The value of the suggestion 
   info will be the generic 'force_ip' parameter that can be used to resolve 
   the problem. This means that if you will pass the suggested 'force_ip' 
   parameter as-is in the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> operator's <tt>Generic</tt> 
   parameter (see its documentation), the GigEVision2 interface will 
   attempt to switch the device temporarily to correct subnet and open it.

<td> With the Generic parameter some important values can be set before the  camera is initialized. Note that the parameter names including the values 
 must be strings, e.g., 'num_buffers=5' sets the number of buffers to 5.<br> 
 The following parameters are available:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>num_buffers:</b> 
   To set the maximum number of acquisition buffers used. Note that 
   depending on the image size of the used camera a high number of 
   buffers can exceed the available memory size of your computer. We 
   recommend to use at least 2 buffers. Notice that the interface internally 
   locks 1 buffer (see <a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">acquisition buffer 
   handling</a>), therefore if your application requires n buffers, 
   'num_buffers' must be set to n+1. Default: 4. 
</li>
<li><b>direct_connection:</b> 
   Enables direct connection to the device using its known GenTL interface 
   and device ID. The GenTL specification allows opening the device directly 
   when the device/interface ID is known, without explicitly instructing 
   the GenTL Producer to refresh its internal device list, thus optimizing 
   unnecessary timeouts. 
   Because some GenTL Producers fail to implement this properly, the 
   parameter is disabled by default. Possible values are 'enable' and 
   'disable'. 
</li>
<li><b>force_ip:</b> 
   Request to force temporary new IP settings to the device before connecting. 
   Used in situations when the device is configured for subnet not matching 
   the interface it is connected to. 
   The parameter format is 
   'force_ip=interface_ip/device_mac/force_device_ip/force_device_mask', 
   where interface_ip is current IP address of the interface the device is expected 
   to be connected to (ie. the interface on which the force IP request should be sent), 
   device_mac is the MAC address of the device to be configured, force_device_ip 
   and force_device_mask is the new IP address and subnet mask to be forced into 
   the device. All the IP addresses are in the usual decimal dot-separated format, 
   the MAC address in the usual hexadecimal colon-separated format. 
   Note that the forced IP settings are not persistent (will not have effect 
   beyond device's reboot. 
   The basic format of the parameter described above can be optionally extended 
   by two additional parameters 
   'force_ip=interface_ip/device_mac/force_device_ip/force_device_mask/force_device_gateway/force_command_timeout', 
   where force_device_gateway is the new default gateway to be configured on the device 
   and force_command_timeout specifies the time in microseconds, how long 
   the operation should wait for device's acknowledge of the force IP success. 
   When not present, default gateway '0.0.0.0' will be used and suitable (short) 
   command acknowledge timeout. 
   Note also that when querying the device list using 
   <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'info_boards'...)</tt>, for each device with 
   incorrect IP settings (wrong subnet), the GigEVision2 
   will suggest the force_ip generic parameter including suitable 
   IP address and other parameters corresponding with the interface device 
   was discovered on (verifying that given suggested IP address is not currently 
   in use on that network segment. When working with the HDevelop 
   Image Acquisition Assistant, it will directly suggest 
   to apply the generic parameter when connecting to the device. 
</li>
<li><b>force_sockdrv:</b> 
   When present, the socket driver is always used for handling of the devices' 
   data stream. The filter driver will not be automatically used even if available. 
   <br>This parameter is applicable on Windows systems only. 
</li>
<li><b>streaming_mode:</b> 
   In order to disable streaming (grab-related operators), this parameter 
   has to be set to 0. The streaming is by default switched on for 
   devices with streaming support. 
</li>
<li><b>device_event_handling:</b> 
   In order to disable device events which can be useful in case of handling 
   multiple cameras to reduce the used resources like the number of transfers 
   in the Producer, this parameter has to be set to 0. The event handling is 
   by default switched on for devices with event support. 
</li>
<li><b>workarounds:</b> 
   Enables one or more of the workarounds supported by the GigEVision2 
   image acquisition interface. The workarounds are options slightly altering 
   the image acquisition interface behavior in order to cope with some common 
   problems of devices 
   . 
   The individual workaround names might be listed using any separator, for 
   example a space or comma.  Supported workarounds are: 

<ul>
<li><i>enable_range_validation:</i> 
   When this workaround is enabled, an additional check is performed when 
   querying the range of a parameter: check if min <= max &ndash; and an error is 
   returned if the check fails. The invalid range of a GenICam based 
   parameter might be the result of a bug in the corresponding GenICam 
   description file.

<td> Controls if the acquisition interface should attempt to append the intensity/color overlay  to the generated 3D object models. Applicable only if a 3D object model is being output

 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

 If this information is insufficient or coordinates are inaccurate, the result of the transformation(s)

   system and actual configuration.<br> 
   The position and orientation of the reference system should be indicated

 The written ini file contains in particular paths to the written 
 GenICam description files and can be reused through the 'CameraType' 
 parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> operator, see <a href="#OPENING_DEVICE"> 
 detailed description in section about device opening</a>. 
 Additionally, it writes also persistence files with current 
 configuration of the device and all GigE Vision Producer modules 
 that can be loaded back when next time opening the device 
 using the same 'CameraType' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> 
 described above. 
 Instead of specifying the path of the output ini file, 'default' 
 or an empty string can be used. In this case the files will be 
 written to the %TEMP% directory and the filename of the configuration 
 file will be halcon_gentl_config.ini. Note that this default option 
 will apply also when using the Image Acquisition Assistant.

 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

   'bits_per_channel' and 'color_space' if used. 
</li>
<li><b>coord_a:</b> 
   The output HALCON image contains data corresponding to the 3D "coordinate A" according

</li>
<li><b>coord_c:</b>

<li><b>coord_mixed:</b> 
   Used when the data is recognized as 3D coordinates but the format is unknown. In this

   the application has to know how to treat the custom data format.  The data are provided

   The output HALCON image contains data corresponding to the pixel confidence, which

<td> Enables a special mode allowing the treatment of integer parameters as tuple  of two 32-bit integers. For compatibility with the single-parameter mode, 
 the first tuple element carries always the low 32-bit part of the value, 
 second element carries the high 32-bit part. It is user's responsibility 
 to combine the two parts correctly. 
 This mode is intended especially to help to overcome the problem of 32-bit 
 HALCON featuring only 32-bit integer parameters but having to face up to 
 64-bit wide GenICam features. 
 In this mode, the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> returns always a tuple of two 
 integers, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> accepts both a single parameter or a tuple. 
 Note that this mode affects only integer parameters and only the GenICam 
 based ones, not the internal parameters of HALCON GigEVision2 
 image acquisition interface - with few exceptions, the 'buffer_timestamp', 
 'buffer_timestamp_ns', 'device_timestamp_frequency' and 'buffer_frameid' 
 internal parameters.

<h2 id="SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">Operator <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a></h2><div> This interface supports feature change callbacks via the operators  <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> and <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_callback.html">get_framegrabber_callback</a>.<br> 
 The callback can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and GigE Vision Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 callback targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_callback_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">event data</a> and <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">feature 
 notifications</a> sections. The 'CallbackType' parameter of 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> defines the feature for which the callback is 
 registered. It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">parameter naming convention</a>).<br> 
 The registered callback function would be called whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value.  If the callback function is set to NULL, the 
 corresponding callback will be unregistered.  Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new callback for a feature that already had a callback registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one. 
 <p> 
 The signature of the callback function is 
 <tt>Herror (__stdcall *HAcqCallback)(void *AcqHandle, void *Context, 
    void *UserContext)</tt> and uses the following parameters: 

<ul>
<li><tt>AcqHandle</tt>: 
   Acquisition handle of the corresponding image acquisition instance. 
</li>
<li><tt>Context</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, this 
   parameter is not used, i.e., Context is set to NULL. 
</li>
<li><tt>UserContext</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, 
   this parameter is not used, i.e., UserContext is set to NULL. 
</li>
</ul> 
</p> 
<p> 
Note that the execution time of a user-specific callback function must 
always be as short as possible since during the execution of a callback 
function the handling of further internal callbacks might be blocked. 
This can be achieved by removing the current processing from the 
user-specific callback function to a separate thread that is controlled 
via signals or events. The callback function is executed in the context 
of the underlying interface or driver.

<h2 id="GEV_1_TO_2">Switching From Previous Implementation of the GigEVision Interface</h2><div>This chapter is intended as a help for users switching to the new version of this acquisition interface (GigEVision2) from its previous 
implementation (GigEVision). Users starting new applications 
directly based on GigEVision2 interface can fully ignore contents 
of this chapter.<br><br> 
The GigEVision2 interface is a significant rewrite of the previous 
interface targetting support of the GigE Vision 2 specification, thorough 
compatibility with the modern versions of the GenICam standards family 
and similar user experience among all GenICam based HALCON acquisition 
interfaces (in particular GigEVision2, USB3Vision and GenICamTL). 
It was not therefore possible to keep full backward compatibility 
with the previous version of this interface.<br><br> 
The most important new features introduced in GigEVision2: 

<ul>
<li>Support of the GigE Vision specification version 2.x. 
</li>
<li>Tight compatibility with current versions of the GenICam standards. 
</li>
<li>Full support of GigE Vision <a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a> 
   and <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a>. 
</li>
<li>Support of multi-part data and in particular native support of 3D devices 
   (<a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>). 
</li>
<li>Introduced support for <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a> and <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators 
   (<a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>). 
</li>
</ul> 
Current limitations that will be addressed in future updates of the interface: 

<ul>
<li>The streaming filter is intended to keep working with both versions of the acquisition 
   interface. Its current version does not yet implement all of the stream 
   engine parameters (stream control and statistics) of the GigEVision2 
   interface. All those differences are clearly highlighted in sections about 
   <a href="#GET_FRAMEGRABBER_PARAM">getting framegrabber parameters</a> and 
   <a href="#SET_FRAMEGRABBER_PARAM">setting framegrabber parameters</a>. 
</li>
</ul> 
Changes related to opening the device (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> and <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a>): 

<ul>
<li>The name of the acquisition interface itself has changed (GigEVision2 
   instead of GigEVision) while both versions currently co-exist. 
</li>
<li>The format of the string identifying the device and the set of options to identify 
   the device has changed, see details about the current format in 
   <a href="#OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</a>. The same changes are also 
   reflected in the <tt>device</tt> and <tt>info_boards</tt> queries in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> operator. 
</li>
<li>Following parameters are ignored in the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> operator: <tt>ImageWidth</tt>, 
   <tt>ImageHeight</tt>, <tt>StartRow</tt>, <tt>StartColumn</tt>, <tt>Field</tt>, 
   <tt>ExternalTrigger</tt>, <tt>Port</tt>, <tt>LineIn</tt>. Corresponding functionality 
   should be configured by setting the GenICam features of each corresponding device. 
</li>
<li>The ability to detect misconfigured devices (IP subnet not matching the network interface 
   the device is connected to) and option to force new temporary IP address to the device 
   while opening still exists - but the format of the string requesting the new IP address 
   has changed to match the new underlying device discovery architecture. Refer to the 
   <tt>force_ip</tt> generic parameter in <a href="#OPEN_FRAMEGRABBER">open_framegraber</a> (replacing the old 
   <tt>GtlForceIP</tt> generic parameter that was using different internal format). 
</li>
<li>Following generic parameters in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> have new names: 

<ul>
<li><tt>num_buffers</tt> instead of <tt>GtlNumBuffers</tt> 
</li>
<li><tt>force_sockdrv</tt> instead of <tt>GtlForceSocketDriver</tt> 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Generic parameters <tt>GtlGVCPRetries</tt> and <tt>GtlGVCPTimeout</tt> are not supported, 
   their functionality is newly accessible through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> parameters 
   <tt>[Device]LinkCommandRetryCount</tt> and <tt>[Device]LinkCommandTimeout</tt>. 
</li>
<li>Generic parameters <tt>GtlUseCameraPacketSize</tt> and <tt>GtlDisableAutomaticTestPackets</tt> 
   are currently not supported at all. 
</li>
</ul> 
Various parameters configuring the acquisition interface and the connected device has changed 
or were removed in the GigEVision2 interface version. This reflects the significantly 
changed internal architecture, now following the GenICam GenTL architecture model reused 
by all GenICam based HALCON acquisition interfaces. See details in 
<a href="#GET_FRAMEGRABBER_PARAM">getting framegrabber parameters</a> and 
<a href="#SET_FRAMEGRABBER_PARAM">setting framegrabber parameters</a>. 

<ul>
<li>The parameters starting with the <tt>Gtl</tt> prefix no more exist (see below to find 
   which of them were replaced by similar parameters with different name). 
</li>
<li>The parameters starting with the <tt>Gev</tt> prefix no more exist (depending on the actual 
   connected device, some of these parameters might still be available, if the device itself 
   provides them). 
</li>
<li>Following additional parameters are no more supported:

</li>
<li><tt>parameters_hidden</tt> 
</li>
<li><tt>GenApiCNodeMapRefPtr</tt> 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul> 

<ul>
<li>Some of the missing parameters listed above were replaced by same or similar purpose parameters

</div>
<h2 id="TROUBLESHOOTING">Troubleshooting</h2><div>In case of problems with the HALCON GigEVision2 Interface the following hints might help to solve them.<br><br> 
<b>General:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the <a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> 
  of the HALCON GigEVision2 interface is used. 
</li>
<li>Check the <a href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</a>. 
</li>
<li>Check if the device has the latest firmware. 
</li>
<li>Enable low-level error messages in HALCON to query more information 
  about the problem (and check the output console in HDevelop if applicable). 
</li>
<li>If your device is connected via Ethernet and 
  a firewall is active in the system, it has to be configured in a way 
  so that all applications expected to be using the GigE Vision devices 
  (e.g. HDevelop, but also any user-developed applications) have full 
  access to the connected devices. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>Filter driver (MVTec GigE Vision Streaming Filter):</b> 

<ul>
<li>In case there are problems with streaming while the filter driver is active 
  it is usually not possible to capture a network packet trace to analyse the 
  problems. Starting with v2.1.8.0 of the filter driver it is possible to set 
  the environment variable ESEN_FILTER_PASSTHROUGH=1 to give other filters 
  like Wireshark's pcap access to the packets. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>GenICam:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the correct GenICam binaries are in use. HALCON uses the official 
  binaries in a private installation (folder genicam in the HALCONROOT 
  directory). If other GenICam binaries are in your path or in some system 
  path (for Windows e.g. in c:\Windows\System32\ for Linux e.g. in /usr/lib 
  or similar directories) make sure these are the official ones by comparing 
  them with the ones in the HALCON installation. Using unofficial binaries 
  might result in strange problems. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>If there are still problems, please contact your local distributor.</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
The following information is needed for your support request to avoid 
unnecessary inquiries. 

<ul>
<li>Used HALCON and acquisition interface versions. 
</li>
<li>Used HALCON architecture (especially 32 or 64 bit). 
</li>
<li>Low-level error messages if there are any. 
</li>
<li>Camera manufacturer, model and firmware version. 
</li>
<li>Details about computer system, like operating system, RAM and CPU. 
</li>
<li>Minimal sample code (e.g. HDevelop script) to reproduce the issue.

<h2 id="RELEASENOTES">Release Notes</h2><div>
<ul>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.3</b> (Oct 30, 2018): 
<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.1. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
      The Update includes an accelerated MathParser, improved persistence 
      in combination with sequencers and a fix where values were available 
      even though the corresponding feature was not. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's File Access is now supported. See the new parameters 
      'fileaccess_file_path', 'fileaccess_remote_name', 
      'do_fileaccess_download', 'do_fileaccess_upload', 
      'do_fileaccess_delete', and the new HDevelop example 
      gigevision2_fileaccess.hdev. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's FWUpdate is now supported. See 
      <a href="#FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</a> and the new HDevelop example 
      gigevision2_fwupdate.hdev. 
</li>
<li>Receiving GenICam events on message queues is now supported, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
      So far, GenICam events were only supported via callbacks and thus 
      not usable in HDevelop. Additionally, two new HDevelop examples have 
      been added to show this functionality 
      gigevision2_acquisition_events.hdev and 
      gigevision2_devicelost_event.hdev. 
</li>
<li>The GigE Vision Producer now supports GenICam action control. 
      For more information, please refer to the new HDevelop example 
      gigevision2_action_control.hdev. 
</li>
<li>The GigE Vision Producer now supports pending acknowledges 
      which allow to wait for device response to long taking commands 
      without needing to manually adjust the timeout. 
</li>
<li>'do_write_configuration' has been extended to store not only the 
      current device configuration but also generate persistence files 
      for all the GigE Vision Producer modules 
      (system, interface, device and data stream), see 
      <a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters 'buffer_timestamp_ns' and 
      'device_timestamp_frequency' to improve the usability of 
      'buffer_timestamp' which on its own is unit-agnostic. 
</li>
<li>Some generic parameters passed to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> were not available 
      through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>String parameters longer than 1024 characters were silently cropped by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When 'start_async_after_grab_async' was set 'disable', 
      the acquisition was stopped on the remote device after each frame. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Some parameters depending on '[Interface]DeviceSelector' (like 
      '[Interface]DeviceTLVersionMajor') were not updated when 
      '[Interface]DeviceSelector' was changed. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>For consistency, the example gigevision2_atc4_objectmodel3d 
      has been renamed to 
      gigevision2_automation_technology_c4_objectmodel3d.hdev. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.2</b> (Apr 27, 2018): 

<ul>
<li>Added support for the 'Mono4p' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'YCbCr411_8' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Unsupported pixel formats are now tried to be returned in their actual 
      image dimensions if they are similar enough to a supported Mono format. 
      Before, all unsupported formats were returned as square images (see 
      <a href="#RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format</a>). 
</li>
<li>On Unix systems, HALCON crashed when ended without calling 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/close_framegrabber.html">close_framegrabber</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When 'DeviceUserID' was set to ' ' (a single space), it could not be 
      used to connect.  This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When trying to connect to a busy device using its 'DeviceUserID', 
      a misleading low-level error appeared. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Device discovery per network interface is now done in parallel. 
</li>
<li>The Windows Firewall can now be traversed if the camera supports the 
      Message Channel Source Port (MCSP) and Stream Channel Source Port 
      (SCSPx) registers. The traversal can be configured with the new 
      parameters '[Device]DeviceMessageChannelKeepAliveTimeout' and 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelKeepAliveTimeout'. 
</li>
<li>The default value of the parameter '[Device]LinkCommandTimeout' 
      has been changed from 400000 to 200000 microseconds. 
</li>
<li>The packet size negotiation algorithm has been revised regarding 
      compliance with the GigE Vision specification. To make it more 
      transparent and configurable, the following parameters have been 
      introduced: '[Interface]GevInterfaceMTU,' 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelPacketSize', 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelPacketSizeMin', 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelPacketSizeMax', 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelPacketSizeInc', 
      '[Stream]DeviceStreamChannelNegotiatePacketSize'. 
</li>
<li>When changing 'GevSCPSPacketSize' dynamically, corrupt or no images at 
      all could be acquired. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The Streaming Filter now works on WiFi interfaces. Before, 
      devices connected via a WiFi interface fell back on the socket driver. 
</li>
<li>The Streaming Filter did not work on Killer network interface cards 
      with jumbo frames. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The socket driver could fail to request a resend of a missing block 
      trailer. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The internal locking of the Streaming Filter has been improved to 
      increase performance and stability especially for multiple cameras. 
</li>
<li>The resend strategy of the Streaming Filter has been revised and 
      optimized for low latency streaming. 
</li>
<li>The parameter '[Stream]GevStreamMaxBlockDuration' had no effect on the 
      Streaming Filter and was instead fixed to 200ms. This problem has been 
      fixed. 
</li>
<li>The following parameters of the socket driver have been adapted or 
      introduced to the Streaming Filter: 
      '[Stream]GevStreamUnavailablePacketCount', 
      '[Stream]GevStreamMaxPacketGaps', 
      '[Stream]GevStreamMaxBlockDuration', 
      '[Stream]GevStreamDeliverIncompleteBlocks', 
      '[Stream]GevStreamFullBlockTerminatesPrev', 
      '[Stream]GevStreamEngineUnderrunCount'. 
</li>
<li>Example for using GigE Vision Chunk Data has been added. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.1</b> (Nov 28, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>First official release.
