<h2 id="GENERAL">General</h2><div>This page provides the documentation of the universal HALCON GenICamTL interface for accessing all <a href="http://www.genicam.org/">GenICam GenTL</a> compliant 
cameras. 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/registration">Registered</a> customers can download the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> of this interface from the 
<a href="http://www.mvtec.com/">MVTec WWW server</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>Intel compatible PC with Windows    7 (32-bit or 64-bit) 
   or newer that is also supported by the used GenTL Producer, 
   XP SP1/Vista/7/8, Windows XP/Vista/7/8 x64, 
   also WoW64 (using 32-bit HALCON on 64-bit Windows), 
   Linux with kernel 2.6 (or higher) 
   , or macOS. 
</li>
<li>Successfully installed <b>GenICam GenTL Producer</b>. 
   The corresponding .cti file must be located in one of the 
   directories specified by the environment variable 
   <tt>GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH</tt> or <tt>GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH</tt>, 
   respectively. Otherwise, the full path to the GenTL Producer has to be 
   specified when opening the device. 
</li>
<li>Depending on the used transport layer make sure that you have access 
   to the device. Follow all requirements and recommendations specified 
   by the respective GenTL Producer(s) to guarantee flawless and effective 
   access to the device(s). Especially for (Gigabit) Ethernet the following 
   points have to be checked: 

<ul>
<li>It is recommended to use a PCIe network adapter which supports 
       jumbo frames. Please configure the network adapter 
       accordingly, e.g., to a MTU value of 9000. 
       Furthermore, the camera should be connected directly to the network 
       adapter to avoid interference with other network traffic. Please be 
       aware that networking equipment like switches not necessarily 
       supports Jumbo frames. 
</li>
<li>If you are using a firewall please make sure that your firewall 
       settings allow communication with the camera for discovery, 
       control and streaming, depending on your used transport layer. 
       For Windows the easiest way to do this is to allow the application 
       (i.e. HDevelop, or your compiled application) at the firewall. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>GenICam version 
   3.0.2 
   </b>. The corresponding files are part of the 
   HALCON runtime installation and are located in the directory 
   <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt>. 
   Since the HALCON GenICamTL interface sets all necessary environment 
   variables on its own, no environment variables like 
   <tt>GENICAM_ROOT_V2_x</tt>, <tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> 
   must be set or modified. Old variables referencing GenICam V1.1, V2.0 
   or V2.1 are not used anymore and should be deleted if not needed by other 
   software. See section <a href="#GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</a> for more details. 
</li>
<li><b>Windows:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqGenICamTL.dll</b> or 
   <b>hAcqGenICamTLxl.dll</b>, respectively. 
   If you have properly installed the interface, all these DLLs should 
   reside in <tt>bin\%HALCONARCH%</tt> within the HALCON base directory 
   %HALCONROOT% you have chosen during the installation of HALCON.<br> 
   <b>Linux:</b> 
   HALCON image acquisition interface <b>hAcqGenICamTL.so</b> or 
   <b>hAcqGenICamTLxl.so</b>, respectively. 
   If you have properly installed the interface, the shared objects 
   should reside in <tt>lib/$HALCONARCH</tt> within the HALCON base 
   directory $HALCONROOT you have chosen during the installation of HALCON. 
   <br><b>macOS:</b> HALCON image acquisition interface 
   <b>hAcqGenICamTL.dylib</b> or <b>hAcqGenICamTLxl.dylib</b>, 
   respectively.  If you have properly installed the interface, the shared 
   objects should reside in the HALCON framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework</tt> or the HALCON XL framework 
   <tt>/Library/Frameworks/HALCONxl.framework</tt> in the <tt>Libraries</tt> 
   subdirectory. 
</li>
<li><b>The default acquisition mode assumes the computer is fast enough to 
   process all buffers from the camera. If this is not the case, they 
   are silently discarded (by the GenTL Producer).</b>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="INSTALLATION">Installation</h2><div>Only when installing or updating the interface manually follow these steps: <br> 

<ul>
<li><b>Windows:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory %HALCONROOT% (Note: Administrator privileges may be 
  required for this step). Additionally, you have to move the interface 
  examples to the directory %HALCONEXAMPLES% manually. 
</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> Extract the archive containing the interface files to the 
  HALCON base directory $HALCONROOT. 
</li>
<li><b>OS X:</b> Extract the archive. Manually move the following files: 

<ul>
<li>The .dylib files located in lib/x64-macosx to 
     /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The genicam folder to /Library/Frameworks/HALCON.framework/Libraries 
</li>
<li>The examples folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Users/Shared/Library/Application Support 
</li>
<li>The doc folder to the version subdirectory at 
     /Library/Application Support
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="ENV_VARS">Environment Variables</h2><div>The interface can be controlled through several environment variables: 
<ul>
<li><tt>GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH</tt>, <tt>GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH</tt> are standard 
  GenTL variables holding the list of directories where individual GenTL 
  Producers are installed. The installer of a GenTL producer usually adapts 
  these variables automatically. Alternatively you can specify the full path 
  to the producer when opening the device. 
</li>
<li><tt>HALCON_ACQUIRED_FILE_PAYLOAD_DIR</tt> is used to specify the directory 
  where non-image payload types (usually files or 'raw' data) are stored 
  using the filename given by the 
  device or GenTL Producer. 
</li>
<li>When specifying a directory with <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_XMLFILE</tt> 
  and/or <tt>HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_RAW_XMLFILE</tt>, the GenICam description 
  files (in XML and/or raw format) will be stored there while working with 
  HALCON. These files can also be stored by setting the interface parameter 
  'do_write_configuration'. 
</li>
<li>If you want to use an already installed GenApi version instead of the 
  one supplied with HALCON, you must set the environment variable 
  <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. Additionally, all environment variables 
  which are necessary for GenApi must also be set in this case. This is 
  only for experts, see also section 
  <a href="#GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</a>.
</li>
</ul></div>

<li>No support of acquisition from devices with read-only access mode 
</li>
<li>Limited support for devices with multiple ROI functionality.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="GENICAM_GENAPI">GenICam GenApi</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>This interface uses GenApi version    3.0.2, 
   for more details refer to the <a href="http://www.genicam.org/">GenICam homepage</a>. The 
   corresponding files are part of the HALCON runtime installation and are 
   located in the directory <tt>genicam</tt> within the HALCON base 
   directory <tt>%HALCONROOT%</tt> or <tt>$HALCONROOT</tt>, respectively. 
   This version is the same as the officially released version at the time 
   of writing. 
</li>
<li>The HALCON GenICamTL interface sets all necessary environment 
   variables on its own and ignores other installed GenICam 
   packages by default.<br> 
   If you want to use another GenICam package, you need to set the 
   environment variable <tt>HALCON_USE_EXTERNAL_GENAPI</tt>. This skips 
   the step of setting all necessary variables and paths internally, so 
   you have to make sure they are set correctly. Please note that it might 
   not be possible to use different GenApi versions with different interfaces 
   at the same time and that you must use the required GenApi version for 
   this interface. 
</li>
<li>The caching of device XML files is activated to speed up processing, 
   Windows uses <tt>%TEMP%</tt> and Linux/macOS use <tt>$TMP</tt> or 
   <tt>/tmp</tt> if <tt>$TMP</tt> is not set for cached XML files.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="GENICAM_GENTL">GenICam GenTL</h2><div>
<ul>
<li>GenTL is part of the <a href="http://www.genicam.org/">GenICam standard</a> and allows generic    communication between a GenTL consumer like the HALCON GenICamTL 
   acquisition interface which is independent of specific transport layers 
   and hardware, and one or more GenTL producers which implement access 
   to the specific device hardware (usually a camera). 
</li>
<li>GenTL producers are usually provided by the device manufacturer. 
   They implement the communication with the device regarding control and 
   data streaming (images) and present it in a uniform way to a GenTL 
   consumer. The consumer uses GenApi to access and control the device 
   features. 
</li>
<li>The available GenICam GenTL Producers are searched within the path 
   set by the environment variable <tt>GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH</tt> or 
   <tt>GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH</tt>, respectively. 
   If none of these variables is set, the full path to the GenTL producer 
   has to be specified (see <a href="#OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and opening 
   a device</a>).
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</h2><div>A device accessible through the GenTL interface is usually described as a set of four entities where the names are given by the specific GenTL 
Producer. 

<ul>
<li><tt>'producer'</tt> - the name of the GenTL Producer which is used to 
  access the device. 
</li>
<li><tt>'interface'</tt> - the name of the (logical) interface where the device 
  is connected. For example an Ethernet based GenTL Producer running on a 
  system with multiple network cards might present the IP or MAC address of 
  the network card where the device is connected as interface name. 
</li>
<li><tt>'device'</tt> - the name of the device (typically camera). Note that 
  a device might be accessible through multiple producers or interfaces and 
  might therefore also be shown with different (hopefully similar) names. 
</li>
<li><tt>'stream'</tt> - the name of each data stream of the device. Currently 
  only devices with no stream (peripherals) or a single (image) data stream 
  are fully supported, therefore this is not yet used. 
</li>
</ul> 
The list of devices can be obtained using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> with parameter 
'info_boards' (all detectable devices) or 'device' (only available ones). 
Each entry consists of entries (the entities listed above and usually some 
additionally ones) separated with a ' | ' (space - pipe - space) sequence.<br> 
The result of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> can be passed directly to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>. 
Alternatively you can specify the device directly. For this 
one or more of the entries can be omitted (or specified as 'default') - which 
is like using wildcards, meaning that the particular ID for that entity 
should not be considered (any ID would match). The HALCON acquisition 
interface will walk the GenTL device tree (producer -&gt; interface -&gt; 
device -&gt; stream), until it finds an exact match for all non-default 
entries.<br> 
The values for the individual entries are evaluated as follows for 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>: 

<ul>
<li><tt>'producer'</tt>: The value is interpreted as filename of the GenTL 
  Producer (always a file with <tt>.cti</tt> extension). If it is specified 
  using the full path, it's opened directly. If only a filename without path 
  is specified, the GenTL installation directories (specified via 
  <tt>GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH</tt> respectively <tt>GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH</tt>) 
  are searched. If the entry is 'default' or omitted, any GenTL Producer 
  found within the GenTL installation directories would match. 
</li>
<li><tt>'interface'</tt>: The value is interpreted as GenTL interface ID 
  (string identifier assigned to the interface by GenTL producer). When 
  'default' or omitted, any interface would match. 
</li>
<li><tt>'device'</tt>: GenTL device ID (string identifier assigned by GenTL 
  producer).  When 'default' or omitted, any device would match, but only a 
  device that is currently reported as accessible by the GenTL producer, 
  non-accessible devices are skipped. 
</li>
<li><tt>'stream'</tt>: GenTL data stream ID. When 'default' or omitted, the 
  first data stream reported for given device is used. 
</li>
</ul> 
When a string without any ' | ' separator is used, it is interpreted 
directly as GenTL device ID (without the leading <tt>device:</tt>, assuming 
that producer, interface and stream are 'default'. 
<p> 
Alternative IDs:<br> 

<ul>
<li>In addition to the GenTL device ID, devices can be opened by their 
  user-defined name ('DeviceUserID') if the device supports it. 
  If set, the string obtained by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> will contain the entry 
  <tt>'user_name:&lt;user-defined name&gt;'</tt>. To make it easier 
  for the user, the <tt>'device'</tt> entry reflects the user-defined name 
  if it is unique. If the same user-defined name is assigned 
  to more than one device, only the first one will use it, 
  all others will use the unique name instead. 
</li>
<li>Some devices might (optionally) allow identifying the interfaces and/or 
  devices using other strings than the GenTL IDs. This might be for example 
  the device's MAC or IP address, serial number 
  or similar. If a GenTL producer supports this, alternative IDs can be used 
  also when opening devices. 
</li>
<li>The GenICamTL interface has to maintain reference counting of the opened 
  producers, interfaces and devices. This is based on GenTL IDs; if using 
  alternative IDs it might be possible that the reference counting does 
  not work properly. We therefore recommend to use either always GenTL IDs 
  or always alternative IDs. 
</li>
</ul> 
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</h2><div>The features of a device or GenTL Producer are described by GenICam feature description files (XML files) that are automatically parsed 
and offered to the user. The HALCON GenICamTL image acquisition interface 
provides access to the features exposed through the following GenICam feature 
description files: 

<ul>
<li>Features of the connected device 
  (in GenTL terminology "remote device"), 
  typically a camera, are usually loaded directly from the connected device. 
</li>
<li>Features of the GenTL Producer, potentially one for each 
  (so called) GenTL module which corresponds to a node in the GenTL device 
  tree to the connected device: 

<ul>
<li>The "system", in GenTL terminology representing the overall behavior 
     of the GenTL Producer itself. 
</li>
<li>The "interface" which is used to connect (logically) the device to the 
     system. 
</li>
<li>The "device" (also "local device") which is a kind of proxy device, 
     controlling the GenTL producer's view of the device. 
</li>
<li>The "data stream" used for the acquisition (if the device provides any 
     data streams). 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul> 
In most cases the GenICam description files are provided by the device and 
the GenTL Producer. It is possible to store a copy of these 
files corresponding to an open connection by using the parameter 
<tt>'do_write_configuration'</tt> (see <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>). 
The command will write all the GenICam 
description files and an "ini" file (details in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) with 
various information, including the location of the written GenICam 
description files, in the following format: 
<pre> 
RemoteFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE% 
SystemFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_GENTL_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfaceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_GENTL_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DeviceFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_GENTL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamFile=%PATH_TO_GENICAM_FILE_OF_GENTL_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
The same ini-file format can be reused to force the HALCON acquisition 
interface to load an alternative XML file for one or more of these entities. 
This can be useful, e.g., for updates or troubleshooting. 
The files listed in the ini file will be used for the given entity instead of 
the original ones. For the entities excluded from the ini file, the GenICam 
description file will be searched and loaded the usual way. To apply the ini 
file, pass its full path to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> in the 'CameraType' 
parameter.<br><br> 
Note that the ini-file can be reused also for other purposes such as 
storing/restoring configuration as described in 
<a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</h2><div>The following groups of parameters exist: 
<ul>
<li>Internal parameters of the HALCON GenICamTL image acquisition 
  interface itself. These are named following the "underscore" naming 
  style, e.g., <tt>color_space</tt>, and are all lowercase. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the 
  (remote) 
  device, usually a camera, use by 
  convention the "CamelCase" style, e.g., <tt>ExposureTime</tt>. 
</li>
<li>GenICam-based parameters of the individual GenTL Producer 
  modules (system, interface, device and data stream) use by convention 
  the same style but are prefixed with the module name in square brackets. 
  Beware that the system and interface modules might potentially be shared by 
  multiple opened devices, so changing their configuration might have side 
  effects on other connections as well. The following prefixes are used: 

<ul>
<li>"[System]", e.g., <tt>[System]TLVendorName</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Interface]", e.g., <tt>[Interface]InterfaceType</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Device]", e.g., <tt>[Device]DeviceID</tt>. 
</li>
<li>"[Stream]", e.g., <tt>[Stream]StreamBufferHandlingMode</tt>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</h2><div>The parameters belonging to the system and interface modules of the GenTL Producer (ie. those with "[System]" and "[Interface]" prefix see 
<a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a> ) must be treated in a special way.<br> 
To grasp their behavior, it is important to understand that they do not describe 
or configure the device itself and do not thus fully belong to the opened instance of the device.<br> 
The interface module parameters belong to the interface on which given device was discovered 
and is shared among all devices open under this interface (see also 
<a href="#OPENING_DEVICE">Identifying and Opening a Device</a>). 
The system module parameters belong to the entire GenTL Producer and are shared 
among all devices open within this GenTL Producer.<br> 
This has several implications. In particular, when accessing the system or interface module parameters 
through multiple device instances, those parameters must be treated as shared resources. 
Modifying those parameters through one device instance affects their values (and possibly values 
of other features depending on them) as seen through other device instances. Initial values of those 
parameters after opening a device instance might depend on the interactions with these features 
from previously opened device instances.
</div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_TYPES">Parameters &ndash; GenICam Data Types</h2><div>HALCON native parameter types are 
<ul>
<li><tt>integer</tt> &ndash; signed integer, 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, 32-bit on 
  32-bit ones 
</li>
<li><tt>real</tt> &ndash; floating point type 
</li>
<li><tt>string</tt> &ndash; classical string 
</li>
</ul> 
When accessing GenICam-based features, the GenICam data types must be mapped 
to the parameter types recognized by HALCON. GenICam offers the following 
types: 

<ul>
<li><tt>IInteger</tt> &ndash; integer value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>real</tt> 
  parameters and when the GenICam feature in question is identified to be an 
  IP or MAC address, the string representation of the address will also be 
  accepted.  It should be highlighted that a problem can occur when running 
  HALCON on a 32-bit platform (where <tt>integer</tt> parameters are 32-bit 
  wide) and accessing a GenICam feature that is naturally 64-bit. In such 
  cases the full range of the feature will not be available to the 
  application and its value might be truncated. Also the sign of the 
  parameter might be misinterpreted. To solve this problem, the parameter 
  'split_param_values_into_dwords' can be used. This maps the 64-bit IInteger 
  value into two 32-bit integer values and vice versa. 
</li>
<li><tt>IFloat</tt> &ndash; floating point value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>real</tt> parameter type. It will also accept <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameters. 
</li>
<li><tt>IString</tt> &ndash; string value, mapped directly to HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type. 
</li>
<li><tt>IBoolean</tt> &ndash; boolean type is handled through HALCON's 
  <tt>integer</tt> parameters, a value of 0 (zero) means logical false, other 
  values mean logical true. 
</li>
<li><tt>IEnumeration</tt> &ndash; enumeration is a type that allows selecting from 
  a set of values that are primarily identified by their name (the values are 
  called 'enum entries'). Enumerations are interfaced through HALCON's 
  <tt>string</tt> parameter type, while the enum entry names are used as the 
  parameter values. 
</li>
<li><tt>ICommand</tt> &ndash; The command type allows to "execute" actions. To 
  execute a command, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a> with an <tt>integer</tt> 
  parameter of any value (the value is ignored). Some commands' execution 
  might take longer time and the command provides feedback when it is done. 
  To query the status, use <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> for that command. It will 
  return an <tt>integer</tt> value of 1 if it "is done" (command execution 
  has finished), 0 if it has not finished yet.  Note that if some other features 
  are designed to be dependent on the command, querying the "is done" status 
  might be essential to get the depending features invalidated (and updated 
  with new values) as soon as the command execution finishes. 
</li>
<li><tt>IRegister</tt> &ndash; The register data type is used for plain memory blobs 
  that cannot be mapped to any other data type. They are interfaced through 
  HALCON's <tt>string</tt> parameter type, the register value is the 
  hexadecimal string representation of the register's memory.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</h2><div>The current status of the device settings (values of all the parameters defining its working state) might be persisted while no acquisition 
is active, i.e. before <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> or after 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', 1)</tt>. 
The persistence functionality consists of two steps, storing the current configuration 
to a file and later re-loading it back to the device. 
The current device settings can be stored using the 'do_write_settings' parameter 
and re-loaded later using the 'do_load_settings' parameter, specifying the desired 
persistence file path in both cases.<br><br> 
Note that while the format of the file is intentionally human readable and the file 
can be hand-modified if desired, such modifications should be done with care 
by someone familiar with the GenICam persistence functionality internals and given 
device. Improper modifications of the file can lead to errors when using it.<br><br> 
It is important to know that while performed by the software, the feature settings 
persistence is actually a camera-side function. If the persistence support is implemented 
incorrectly or incompletely by the device, it will not work as expected &ndash; in such 
a case the camera manufacturer could provide additional information or help.<br><br> 
The same persistence file can be applied to the entire set of devices of the same type 
and firmware version. Applying the persistence file to a device of another type 
or using even different firmware version will probably lead to inconsistencies 
or will even fail completely &ndash; the corresponding device manufacturer should provide 
guidelines for such use cases.<br><br> 
Apart from the 'do_write_settings', the feature persistence file will also be written 
together with the ini file documented in the section 
<a href="#XML_SELECTION">Selection of GenICam Feature Description File(s)</a> - using parameter 
'do_write_configuration'. This command 
will also generate persistence files for all the GenTL Producer modules 
(system, interface, device and data stream). 
The persistence file entries in the ini file 
will have the format 
<pre> 
RemotePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_THE_DEVICE%</tt> 
SystemPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_GENTL_SYSTEM_MODULE% 
InterfacePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_GENTL_INTERFACE_MODULE% 
DevicePersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_GENTL_DEVICE_MODULE% 
StreamPersistence=%PATH_TO_PERSISTENCE_FILE_OF_GENTL_STREAM_MODULE% 
</pre> 
If the persistence functionality is not supported properly (or at all) by a given 
device, use the GenICam features UserSetSave/UserSetLoad, if supported by the device. 
These features will allow to store/load the device settings in the device's 
non-volatile memory.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OVERVIEW">Acquisition &ndash; Overview, Device Control</h2><div>The image acquisition can be either synchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>) or asynchronous (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>), 
see the reference documentation of the operators.<br> 
The interface fully configures and controls the acquisition process on the 
camera and GenTL producer. 
Note that some of the camera 
or producer 
features might be locked by GenICam when an acquisition is active.<br> 
With synchronous grab (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>), a new acquisition is started 
internally for each image, so that the application always gets a new image. 
Before delivering the image, the acquisition is stopped again, so between 
individual <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a> calls, all acquisition related features 
remain unlocked.<br> 
With asynchronous grabbing, started explicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_start.html">grab_image_start</a> or 
implicitly by <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>, the interface keeps the 
acquisition running internally, collecting further images to be delivered 
through future <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> calls. The acquisition related 
features are locked, until the acquisition is stopped using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.<br> 
Note that the interface properly recognizes the 'Continuous', 'SingleFrame' 
and 'MultiFrame' acquisition modes configured on the device and adjusts the 
acquisition control logic accordingly.<br> 
Note that the HALCON acquisition interface itself takes over exclusive access 
to several remote device features essential for the acquisition control 
(AcquisitionStart, AcquisitionStop, AcquisitionAbort, TLParamsLocked). The 
user application has no direct way to control these features.<br> 
The differences between the "image" and "data" version of the grab operators 
is documented in 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</h2><div>The interface allocates 4 buffers for the acquisition engine by default (the number of buffers can be changed through the 'Generic' parameter of 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>).<br> 
Whenever a new image is acquired successfully and passed to the application 
as a HALCON image, the interface keeps the buffer locked (not returning it to 
the acquisition engine) until a new grab-related operator is called by the 
application or the acquisition is aborted using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'do_abort_grab', ...)</tt>.  During this 
period, it is fully safe to query information about this "last acquired" 
buffer &ndash; for example query buffer properties through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> 
parameters such as 'buffer_timestamp', 'buffer_is_incomplete', 
'image_width' and 'image_height'. This applies also to 
<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a> 
eventually present in the buffer and is also usable in volatile 
mode.<br> 
When a new grab-related operator is called by the application, the interface 
returns the buffer to the acquisition engine and buffer-related queries are 
not valid anymore.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_IMAGE_FORMAT">Acquisition &ndash; Image Format Handling</h2><div>With modern, generic image acquisition interfaces an application cannot make valid assumptions about the image format coming from the device based on the 
current settings. Some devices for example allow changing the image format 
properties while the acquisition is active. 
Other setups contain multiple devices in the 
acquisition path (and e.g. a frame grabber might be modifying the image 
format provided by the camera). 
<br> 
The HALCON GenICamTL image acquisition interface fully supports these 
use cases.  It checks the image format and other important properties of 
every single buffer and generates HALCON images corresponding to both the 
acquired image format and eventual user configured output format parameters 
such as 'color_space' and 'bits_per_channel'. Only if the necessary 
information about the buffer are missing 
(i.e., the GenTL Producer does not support it) 
, the current settings are used as a fallback.
</div>
<h2 id="ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</h2><div>The acquisition interface provides two mechanisms for acquisition of the image (or other) data from the device, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> and 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>. Each of them might be more suitable for different 
use cases. Internally, both mechanisms work exactly the same (in particular 
how they acquire and process the data from the device), they differ in the way 
how the outputs are provided to the application.<br> 
The "traditional" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators are still well suitable 
in simple use cases when just a single 2D image is acquired from the device. 
It is also currently used e.g. by the HDevelop's Image Acquisition Assistant. 
However, in case when the device is streaming more complex data structures, 
such as 3D data, multi-AOI or similar data, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> 
is not able to provide all the outputs. In all these cases it will simply 
provide the first image found in the acquired data.<br> 
The "extended" <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators allow to output arbitrary 
number of HALCON images and also arbitrary number of control data. It is therefore 
suitable for use in advanced use cases when more than just a single HALCON image 
should be output. An important use case is acquisition from 3D devices 
(<a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>) when the operators can build and output 
the 3D object model through the control data output. It can be also used 
in other (possibly even device-specific) situations when the device outputs 
multiple images for a single acquisition.<br> 
The structure of the provided outputs can be queried with help of the 
'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.<br> 
The <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> can also be used in the simple single-image 
use cases - in that case they will simply provide a single HALCON image 
and zero control data outputs. They can thus be used as full replacement 
of the traditional <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> operators.
</div>
<h2 id="USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</h2><div>The acquisition interface fully supports the GenICam standard 3D device model and is thus capable to seamlessly integrate 3D devices compliant with this 
model. This means in particular that the application does not need to care 
about device-specific ways of 3D data formatting, the acquisition interface 
will generate the 3D data under the hood using the information from the device.<br> 
If instructed so (using the 'create_objectmodel3d' parameter), the acquisition 
interface will generate the 3D object model from the coordinate data acquired 
from the device. This model can be directly used by the HALCON's 3D object model 
related operators.<br> 
The completeness and accuracy of the final 3D object model strongly depends 
on the actual coordinate data and in particular on the 3D configuration information 
provided by the device. Because the 3D configuration metadata are typically passed 
from the device through the chunk data mechanism 
(<a href="#CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</a>), it is essential to observe that 
the chunk data generation is fully enabled on the device.<br> 
If some of the important 3D configuration information is missing, the acquisition 
interface will try to use the suitable defaults, but the quality of the 3D object 
model output can be lowered.<br> 
The creation of the 3D object model can be further affected by additional parameters 
such as 'coordinate_transform_mode', 'confidence_mode', 'confidence_threshold', 
'add_objectmodel3d_overlay_attrib'.<br> 
Note: for devices not complying with the GenICam standard 3D device model 
the HALCON 3D object model cannot be automatically generated.<br> 
Note that the 3D object model output is only supported by the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> 
operators, it cannot be acquired using <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a>. Besides the 
3D object model, the <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> operators also output the actual 
raw coordinate data in form of HALCON images. The individual outputs can be identified 
with help of 'image_contents', 'data_contents' and related parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format &ndash; Custom Pixel Formats, Non-image Buffers</h2><div>The HALCON GenICamTL image acquisition interface has a built-in converter from the pixel formats described in the GenICam Standard Features Naming 
Convention to the desired HALCON image format. The parameters ColorSpace 
and BitsPerChannel (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>, eventually <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>) 
define the desired format of the resulting HALCON image.  If these parameters 
are set to defaults, the original pixel format coming from the device is 
preserved.<br> 
To offer a basic support of custom pixel formats (i.e., pixel formats not 
defined by PFNC or not supported by HALCON), the ColorSpace value 'raw' can 
be used. In this case the image acquisition interface delivers the buffer to the 
application without any format conversions.<br> 
Note that the same principle is applied whenever a buffer containing other 
than image data is acquired. Examples of such buffers can be files (e.g., 
compressed images) or raw data (results of smart camera processing). Such 
buffers are not real "images", but can still be delivered to the application 
as 'raw' HALCON images. It is the responsibility of the application to know 
how to interpret such data.<br> 
Last but not least, the 'raw' color space can also be used if the user explicitly wishes 
to receive raw input data without any conversions. For example when 
acquiring Bayer encoded images, specifying 'raw' means that the interface 
should not attempt to decode them to RGB or monochrome format, but deliver 
the data directly to the application.<br> 
It is important to know that when the interface does not have full information 
about the image format (dimensions and pixel format), it has to choose an 
artificial one.  In such a case it delivers always an 8-bit image with 
dimensions matching the buffer size (square root of the image size). 
Eventually an unused tail of the HALCON image (if such an artificial image is 
bigger than the source buffer) will be padded with zeroes.  The fact whether 
the last acquired buffer contained an image of known properties or a blob of 
other data (so that the artificial HALCON image size had to be used) as well 
as the size of the eventual tail padding can be queried using 
'raw_buffer_type' and 'raw_buffer_padding_bytes' parameters.
</div>
<h2 id="CHUNK_DATA">Chunk Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible cameras can deliver additional meta-data with every image in a so-called chunk data format. It is usually necessary to enable 
the delivery of individual meta-data "chunks" using the features 
'ChunkModeActive' and 'ChunkSelector'/'ChunkEnable' first.<br> 
The decoding of the chunk data and matching them to the corresponding camera 
features is performed transparently by the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism, i.e., <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. The choice of the meta-data to be 
delivered is device-specific. The names of the chunk related features usually 
start by convention with a prefix 'Chunk' (examples might be 
'ChunkExposureTime' or 'ChunkGain'), however, the camera documentation should 
contain all the information about supported chunks and their corresponding 
feature names.<br> 
It is important to remember, that the chunk data related features will 
provide only meaningful values if the "last acquired buffer" is valid, i.e., 
between delivery of the last image and next call to any grab-related operator 
(refer to section 
<a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">Acquisition &ndash; Buffer Handling</a>).
</div>
<h2 id="FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</h2><div>It is possible to receive notifications about changes of any features exposed through the GenICam interface by the camera and GenTL Producer.<br> 
Note that the notifications might be raised in various circumstances, 
including: 

<ul>
<li>The application (you) explicitly changed that feature. 
</li>
<li>Another feature has changed and the notified feature "depends" on the 
  changed feature (the dependencies are defined in the GenICam description 
  file). 
</li>
<li>Access mode or current range for the feature has changed. 
</li>
<li>As a result of regular "polling" in case of uncached features. 
</li>
<li>As a result of device event delivery if the feature is connected to that 
  event. 
</li>
<li>As a result of new buffer delivery for features corresponding to chunk 
  data. 
</li>
</ul> 
Note that the notifications are raised whenever the feature is "marked dirty" 
(its cache invalidated) by one of the actions described above. It does not 
necessarily mean that its value has really changed, it is up to the 
application to check this.<br> 
Notification callbacks can be registered for individual features using 
<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> - see <a href="#SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">corresponding 
operator documentation</a>. Additionally, it is possible to use 
message queues to receive the event notification. In those cases it is necessary 
to create a message queue and then register the individual feature - see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">event message queues</a>.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_DATA">Event Data</h2><div>GenICam compatible devices can deliver asynchronous events which optionally carry additional data. It is usually necessary to enable delivery 
of individual event types using the features 
'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' first. 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The decoding of the event data and matching them to the corresponding 
features, including potential notifications, is performed transparently by 
the interface.<br> 
The actual values might be read through the regular parameter reading 
mechanism like <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a> or by get_message_tuple if you are 
using message queues to receive events. The choice of the event types to be 
generated is device-specific.  The names of the event related features 
usually start by convention with a prefix 'Event' (examples might be 
'EventFrameTrigger' and 'EventFrameTriggerTimestamp'), however, the device 
documentation should contain all the information about supported events and 
their corresponding feature names.<br> 
Although the data corresponding to the last delivered event can be in general 
read at any time, when using callback to receive events it is highly recommended 
that reading the event data is synchronized to notifications for corresponding 
event feature(s). Only in such a case it is guaranteed that the read data correspond 
exactly to the very event instance being notified &ndash; and that the feature 
values are not just being modified through a new instance of the same event. 
Note that the notifications are raised from context of the event handling/dispatching 
thread, so when processing the user callback, the event handling mechanism is 
paused. If multiple data items are associated with the same event, it is 
enough to register notification just for the actual event feature and read 
all the data during the callback.<br> 
If using message queues to receive events, you can decide to add additional data 
to be delivered with the corresponding event feature(s), see 
<a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
For this case the interface will read all the specified event features 
as soon as the event is generated and add it to the corresponding message. 
This guarantees that the delivered information corresponds with the actual 
value at the time the event was generated.<br> 
Besides the asynchronous events generated by the actual device, asynchronous 
events (optionally including additional data) can be generated by any 
module of the GenTL Producer (system, interface, device 
and data stream). The information provided above about handling of the device 
events applies similarly also to the GenTL Producer events, 
including enabling/disabling them (typically using 'EventSelector'/'EventNotification' 
features provided by given module, i.e. with corresponding module prefix 
in the feature name). 
For SFNC-compliant events, this is done automatically if the parameter 
'event_notification_helper' is enabled.<br> 
The interface will automatically capture and decode the events and match them 
to the corresponding GenTL Producer features. It is only important 
to understand that because the system and interface modules are potentially 
shared among multiple opened devices 
(see <a href="#PARAMETER_SHARING">Parameters &ndash; Sharing Among Devices</a>) and so, 
the same applies for asynchronous events generated by these shared modules.
</div>
<h2 id="EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</h2><div> This interface supports feature change notifications via message queues.  Select the desired target feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_selector', ...)</tt>. 
 It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">Parameters &ndash; Naming Conventions</a>).<br> 
 Create a message queue at which you want to receive the notifications with 
 <tt>create_message_queue</tt> and assign it to the selected feature with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', QueueHandle)</tt>.<br> 
 The message queue can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and GenTL Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_event_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a> and 
 <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">Feature Change Notifications</a> sections.<br> 
 A new message would be added to the specified queue whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value. 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_message_queue', 0)</tt> 
 unregisters the previously registered message queue from the specified event. 
 Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new message queue for a feature that already had a message queue registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one.<br> 
 The messages incoming on an event can be retrieved with 
 <tt>dequeue_message</tt> and will contain at least three tuples. 
 The first tuple (key 'id') is a unique identifier of the acquisition 
 instance the event is coming from. It is a string composed as 
 '&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt;'. The second tuple (key 'event_name') 
 is the name of the corresponding feature previously specified by 
 'event_selector'. The third tuple (key 'event_value') contains the value 
 if the corresponding feature if available. 
 If you decide to add additional data to be delivered with the 
 corresponding event feature(s), add the features of interest with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'event_data', ...)</tt>. 
 Each event data feature will be appended to the event message 
 with the key being its name and the tuple its value if available.

<h2 id="USING_HDEVELOP_IMAGE_ACQUISITION_ASSISTANT">Using HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant</h2><div>  In case of using the HDevelop Image Acquisition Assistant the following   hints will help to avoid problems:<br> 

<ul>
<li>Some parameters depend on special conditions, e.g., a valid buffer or 
    another parameter activated. After opening the camera these conditions 
    may not yet be fulfilled, so the depending parameters are not shown. 
    By using the 'Refresh' button, all parameters are read again and the 
    depending parameters should appear if the conditions are fulfilled 
    then. 
</li>
<li>There are also some parameters regarding the image size and the payload 
    size, which can only be changed if no acquisition takes place. The 
    safest way to ensure this is to apply the action parameter 
    'do_abort_grab'.  Please note that 'Update Image' has to be disabled 
    first. 
</li>
<li>The behavior of allowing changes to parameters while streaming is 
    active depends on the capabilities of the device. It is possible that 
    some cameras give you control over, e.g., the exposure time, while 
    streaming and others do not.
</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="USING_COLOR_CONVERSION">Using Internal Color Conversion</h2><div> The HALCON GenICamTL interface supports an internal color conversion performed in software. The conversion is automatically applied for PFNC (Pixel Format Naming Convention) compatible cameras, when the color format delivered by the camera differs from the user defined format if set via the parameter 'color_space'. The used transformation algorithms are basic and optimized for speed.<br>  <p> 
 Following transformations from the camera color space (see also PFNC) to the interface color space (see also 'color_space' parameter in this document) are supported:<br>

</div>
<h2 id="FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</h2><div>The acquisition interface supports the GenICam FWUpdate standard, allowing to update firmware on devices supporting the same standard in a generic way. 
If the device supports the standard, its vendor would distribute the firmware 
update files in form of GUF files, i.e. files with <tt>.guf</tt> extension.<br> 
To apply the firmware update, the device must be opened (<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>) 
in a special configuration mode (called "safe mode"). This mode is selected 
through the 'Generic' parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> - the parameter must 
include 'device_access=safe-mode'.<br> 
When opened in the safe mode, most of the usual parameters (either those 
provided by HALCON acquisition interface, the device itself or the 
GenTL Producer) will be unavailable. Instead, the configuration 
parameters corresponding to the given device and interface technology and in 
particular the parameters related to firmware update will become available.<br> 
To update the device, the GUF file is first selected in 'fwupdate_file_path', 
one of the (possibly multiple) updates from the file selected using 
'fwupdate_update_selector' and finally applied through 'do_fwupdate_apply'. 
Documentation of these parameters provides further details.<br> 
Note that the update procedure may include one or more device resets, 
after which the device has to be re-discovered by the acquisition interface. 
The time needed for reset and re-discovery is specified by device vendor 
in the GUF file. However, there might be situations (depending on the device 
itself, its connection technology and system setup) when the re-discovery 
timeout is not sufficient and the device fails to get safely re-discovered. 
In such case, it is possible to specify an addtional timeout that would be added 
to the one specified in the GUF file, allowing to successfully complete 
the process. This parameter, 'fwupdate_wait_after_reset', specifies the 
additional timeout in milliseconds.<br>

<td> With the Generic parameter some important values can be set before the  camera is initialized. Note that the parameter names including the values 
 must be strings, e.g., 'num_buffers=5' sets the number of buffers to 5.<br> 
 The following parameters are available:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>num_buffers:</b> 
   To set the maximum number of acquisition buffers used. Note that 
   depending on the image size of the used camera a high number of 
   buffers can exceed the available memory size of your computer. We 
   recommend to use at least 2 buffers. Notice that the interface internally 
   locks 1 buffer (see <a href="#ACQUISITION_BUFFER_HANDLING">acquisition buffer 
   handling</a>), therefore if your application requires n buffers, 
   'num_buffers' must be set to n+1. Default: 4. 
</li>
<li><b>device_access:</b> 
   With this parameter the access mode of the device can be set. Valid 
   values are  'exclusive' for exclusive read/write access, 
   'control' for read/write access with possibility that another application 
   connects in read-only mode, and 'read-only' for read-only access. 
   Special value 'safe-mode' opens the device in restricted mode allowing 
   to execute firmware update (see <a href="#FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</a>). 
   Default: 'exclusive'. 
</li>
<li><b>direct_connection:</b> 
   Enables direct connection to the device using its known GenTL interface 
   and device ID. The GenTL specification allows opening the device directly 
   when the device/interface ID is known, without explicitly instructing 
   the GenTL Producer to refresh its internal device list, thus optimizing 
   unnecessary timeouts. 
   Because some GenTL Producers fail to implement this properly, the 
   parameter is disabled by default. Possible values are 'enable' and 
   'disable'. 
</li>
<li><b>streaming_mode:</b> 
   In order to disable streaming (grab-related operators), this parameter 
   has to be set to 0. The streaming is by default switched on for 
   devices with streaming support. 
</li>
<li><b>device_event_handling:</b> 
   In order to disable device events which can be useful in case of handling 
   multiple cameras to reduce the used resources like the number of transfers 
   in the Producer, this parameter has to be set to 0. The event handling is 
   by default switched on for devices with event support. 
</li>
<li><b>workarounds:</b> 
   Enables one or more of the workarounds supported by the GenICamTL 
   image acquisition interface. The workarounds are options slightly altering 
   the image acquisition interface behavior in order to cope with some common 
   problems of devices 
   and GenTL Producers 
   . 
   The individual workaround names might be listed using any separator, for 
   example a space or comma.  Supported workarounds are: 

<ul>
<li><i>enable_range_validation:</i> 
   When this workaround is enabled, an additional check is performed when 
   querying the range of a parameter: check if min <= max &ndash; and an error is 
   returned if the check fails. The invalid range of a GenICam based 
   parameter might be the result of a bug in the corresponding GenICam 
   description file. 
</li>
<li><i>buffer_alloc_by_consumer:</i> 
   The acquisition buffers are allocated by the image acquisition interface 
   itself (the "GenTL Consumer") rather than by the GenTL Producer. To be 
   used in rare situations when the GenTL problems fails to support buffer 
   allocation properly.  Both ways of allocation are equivalent in most 
   cases, except situations when the Producer has special requirements, such 
   as allocating aligned memory or similar - therefore the allocation by the 
   GenTL Producer is chosen by default. 
</li>
<li><i>ignore_buffer_pixelformat:</i> 
   This workaround requires that the image pixel format reported by GenTL 
   Producer in individual buffers is ignored. Pixel format currently 
   configured in the GenICam feature 'PixelFormat' of the device is used 
   instead.  Intended for rare situations when the pixel format reported in 
   the buffer might be incorrect for given GenTL Producer and device 
   combination.  Note that this approach might not lead to correct results, 
   for example when the GenTL Producer modifies the image data or when the 
   device might allow changing the pixel format during active acquisition. 
   Therefore this workaround should be used with special care. 
</li>
<li><i>indirect_event_handling:</i> 
   Some aspects of event handling between, especially related to the 
   'EventKill()' GenTL function were not specified fully unambiguously 
   in the GenTL standard. If the GenTL Producer implements the event 
   handling in an unexpected way, various problems including deadlocks 
   could occur. This workaround allows to avoid such problems 
   by handling the event related GenTL calls in the Consumer rather than 
   relying on the GenTL Producer. 
</li>
<li><i>tolerate_missing_acquisition_control_features:</i> 
   Tolerates if otherwise required features to control acquisition 
   (in particular the 'AcquisitionStart' and 'AcquisitionStop' commands) 
   are not provided by the device. Note that in this case it is automatically 
   assumed that the device uses 'Continuous' acquisition mode (unlimited 
   number of frames per acquisition) and any other acquisition mode would not 
   work reliably. This workaround is automatically switched on for 
   CameraLink devices.

<td>'disable'</td>
<td>string</td>
<td> Controls if the acquisition interface should attempt to append the intensity/color overlay  to the generated 3D object models. Applicable only if a 3D object model is being output 
 from given grab operator. 
 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

 The threshold to distinguish between valid and invalid pixels is controlled using the 'confidence_threshold' 
 parameter.<br> 
 Note that in some use cases there might be other criteria how to mark given pixel invalid, for example 
 if the device uses "invalid pixel value" for a 3D coordinate. These cases are not covered by the 
 'confidence_mode' parameter and such invalid pixels are always rejected from the 3D object model.

   If the pixel confidence level information is available, it is applied to the eventually generated 
   3D object models (but not to any other outputs, in particular not to the image outputs).

 The threshold is interpreted as a (float) ratio between 0.0 and 1.0. The acquisition interface 
 will remap this ratio to the actual confidence range provided by the device and use it to decide 
 which pixels are valid and which not. Pixels with confidence lower than the specified threshold

<td> Controls which coordinate transformation operations should the acquisition interface attempt to  perform when building the 3D object model from acquired 3D coordinates. Note that the decision 
 which transformation should be performed and which parameters should be used fully depends 
 on the 3D configuration information provided by the device together with the acquired data. 
 If this information is insufficient or coordinates are inaccurate, the result of the transformation(s) 
 might be meaningless or unpredictable. 
 Refer to <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a> for more details.<br> 
 Possible values are:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>none:</b> 
   The acquisition interface will not perform any coordinate transformation. The 3D object model 
   will contain the "raw" coordinates, possibly only scaled depending on the hints from the device. 
</li>
<li><b>cartesian:</b> 
   If the coordinate system used by the device is other than Cartesian, the acquisition interface 
   will convert the coordinates to Cartesian system (native for HALCON's 3D object model). 
   It will not attempt to further transform the coordinates from the device's internal ("anchor") 
   coordinate system to the reference system. 
</li>
<li><b>reference:</b> 
   Default mode. 
   Will transform to Cartesian coordinates if needed and then attempt to transform to 
   the "reference" coordinate system if the device supports it and provides corresponding 
   instructions. The purpose of the reference system is to allow merging and aligning data 
   from multiple devices. The reference system is in contrast with the native ("anchor") 
   coordinate system which is device specific and corresponds to its actual measurement 
   system and actual configuration.<br> 
   The position and orientation of the reference system should be indicated 
   by a reference point marker on the device's housing.<br> 
   This always directly implies the transformation to Cartesian coordinates because the reference 
   coordinate system is always Cartesian.

<td>string</td>
<td>pre-defined</td>
<td> Controls if the acquisition interface should attempt to append the intensity/color overlay  to the generated 3D object models. Applicable only if a 3D object model is being output 
 from given grab operator. 
 When switched on, the acquisition interface will try to find suitable information within 
 the acquired data (if it is provided by the device). If so, it appends the overlay 
 information for each point in the output model in form of an extended attribute. 
 Note that in some advanced use cases there might be multiple potential overlay images 
 output by the device, the acquisition interface therefore attempts to find the most 
 suitable one.<br> 
 First, it tries to identify data marked as "intensity" image in the acquired data. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&intensity_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&intensity_red', '&intensity_green' and '&intensity_blue'.<br> 
 If "intensity" data cannot be identified, it tries to find data marked as "reflectance". If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&reflectance_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&reflectance_red', '&reflectance_green' and '&reflectance_blue'.<br> 
 Finally, if neither "intensity" nor "reflectance" data can be identified (either not present 
 or not correctly marked by the device, it picks the first 2D image within the acquired data 
 than can be mapped to the 3D coordinates. If found 
 and provided as monochrome 2D image, it is appended as '&overlay_gray' extended attribute. 
 If found and provided as RGB image, it is appended as three extended attributes, 
 '&overlay_red', '&overlay_green' and '&overlay_blue'.<br> 
 If no suitable 2D image is found, no overlay is appended. The actually appended extended attributes 
 can be queried for example using the get_object_model_3d_params operator with the 
 'extended_attribute_names' parameter. The overlay can be also used for visualization purposes.

 The threshold to distinguish between valid and invalid pixels is controlled using the 'confidence_threshold' 
 parameter.<br> 
 Note that in some use cases there might be other criteria how to mark given pixel invalid, for example 
 if the device uses "invalid pixel value" for a 3D coordinate. These cases are not covered by the

   If the pixel confidence level information is available, it is applied to the eventually generated 
   3D object models (but not to any other outputs, in particular not to the image outputs).

 'confidence_mode' parameter.<br> 
 The threshold is interpreted as a (float) ratio between 0.0 and 1.0. The acquisition interface 
 will remap this ratio to the actual confidence range provided by the device and use it to decide 
 which pixels are valid and which not. Pixels with confidence lower than the specified threshold

<td> Controls which coordinate transformation operations should the acquisition interface attempt to  perform when building the 3D object model from acquired 3D coordinates. Note that the decision 
 which transformation should be performed and which parameters should be used fully depends 
 on the 3D configuration information provided by the device together with the acquired data. 
 If this information is insufficient or coordinates are inaccurate, the result of the transformation(s) 
 might be meaningless or unpredictable. 
 Refer to <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a> for more details.<br> 
 Possible values are:<br> 

<ul>
<li><b>none:</b> 
   The acquisition interface will not perform any coordinate transformation. The 3D object model 
   will contain the "raw" coordinates, possibly only scaled depending on the hints from the device. 
</li>
<li><b>cartesian:</b> 
   If the coordinate system used by the device is other than Cartesian, the acquisition interface 
   will convert the coordinates to Cartesian system (native for HALCON's 3D object model). 
   It will not attempt to further transform the coordinates from the device's internal ("anchor") 
   coordinate system to the reference system. 
</li>
<li><b>reference:</b> 
   Default mode. 
   Will transform to Cartesian coordinates if needed and then attempt to transform to 
   the "reference" coordinate system if the device supports it and provides corresponding 
   instructions. The purpose of the reference system is to allow merging and aligning data 
   from multiple devices. The reference system is in contrast with the native ("anchor") 
   coordinate system which is device specific and corresponds to its actual measurement 
   system and actual configuration.<br> 
   The position and orientation of the reference system should be indicated 
   by a reference point marker on the device's housing.<br> 
   This always directly implies the transformation to Cartesian coordinates because the reference 
   coordinate system is always Cartesian.

<li><b>coord_a:</b>

<h2 id="SET_FRAMEGRABBER_CALLBACK">Operator <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a></h2><div> This interface supports feature change callbacks via the operators  <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> and <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_callback.html">get_framegrabber_callback</a>.<br> 
 The callback can be registered for any GenICam based features, 
 i.e., features published by the device and GenTL Producer 
 through the GenICam description files. The list of supported 
 callback targets can be queried by calling 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'available_callback_types', ...)</tt>.<br> 
 One of the important use cases for feature change callbacks 
 is the device event delivery mechanism, see details in 
 <a href="#EVENT_DATA">event data</a> and <a href="#FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS">feature 
 notifications</a> sections. The 'CallbackType' parameter of 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> defines the feature for which the callback is 
 registered. It is the same plain feature name as used with 
 <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_param.html">set_framegrabber_param</a>, including a possible prefix, such as '[Device]' (refer to 
 the <a href="#PARAMETER_NAMING">parameter naming convention</a>).<br> 
 The registered callback function would be called whenever a given feature is 
 potentially changed (including its other properties such as range or access 
 mode). Note that it does not necessarily always mean that the feature 
 actually has a new value.  If the callback function is set to NULL, the 
 corresponding callback will be unregistered.  Note that the interface keeps 
 just a single registration for every feature, if you attempt to register a 
 new callback for a feature that already had a callback registered, the 
 previous registration will be replaced with the new one. 
 <p> 
 The signature of the callback function is 
 <tt>Herror (__stdcall *HAcqCallback)(void *AcqHandle, void *Context, 
    void *UserContext)</tt> and uses the following parameters: 

<ul>
<li><tt>AcqHandle</tt>: 
   Acquisition handle of the corresponding image acquisition instance. 
</li>
<li><tt>Context</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, this 
   parameter is not used, i.e., Context is set to NULL. 
</li>
<li><tt>UserContext</tt>: 
   Optional context data of the specific callback. Up to now, 
   this parameter is not used, i.e., UserContext is set to NULL. 
</li>
</ul> 
</p> 
<p> 
Note that the execution time of a user-specific callback function must 
always be as short as possible since during the execution of a callback 
function the handling of further internal callbacks might be blocked. 
This can be achieved by removing the current processing from the 
user-specific callback function to a separate thread that is controlled 
via signals or events. The callback function is executed in the context 
of the underlying interface or driver.

<h2 id="TROUBLESHOOTING">Troubleshooting</h2><div>In case of problems with the HALCON GenICamTL Interface the following hints might help to solve them.<br><br> 
<b>General:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the <a href="http://www.mvtec.com/download/halcon/">latest revision</a> 
  of the HALCON GenICamTL interface is used. 
</li>
<li>Check the <a href="#SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</a>. 
</li>
<li>Check for a newer version of the used GenICam GenTL Producer. 
</li>
<li>Check if the device has the latest firmware. 
</li>
<li>Enable low-level error messages in HALCON to query more information 
  about the problem (and check the output console in HDevelop if applicable). 
</li>
<li>If your device is connected via Ethernet and 
  a firewall is active in the system, it has to be configured in a way 
  so that all applications expected to be using the GigE Vision devices 
  (e.g. HDevelop, but also any user-developed applications) have full 
  access to the connected devices. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>GenICam:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Check if the correct GenICam binaries are in use. HALCON uses the official 
  binaries in a private installation (folder genicam in the HALCONROOT 
  directory). If other GenICam binaries are in your path or in some system 
  path (for Windows e.g. in c:\Windows\System32\ for Linux e.g. in /usr/lib 
  or similar directories) make sure these are the official ones by comparing 
  them with the ones in the HALCON installation. Using unofficial binaries 
  might result in strange problems. 
</li>
</ul> 
<b>If there are still problems, please contact your local distributor.</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
The following information is needed for your support request to avoid 
unnecessary inquiries. 

<ul>
<li>Used HALCON and acquisition interface versions. 
</li>
<li>Used HALCON architecture (especially 32 or 64 bit). 
</li>
<li>Low-level error messages if there are any. 
</li>
<li>Camera manufacturer, model and firmware version. 
</li>
<li>Details about the used GenICam GenTL Producer (at least name and version). 
</li>
<li>Details about computer system, like operating system, RAM and CPU. 
</li>
<li>Minimal sample code (e.g. HDevelop script) to reproduce the issue. 
</li>
<li>Description of observed and expected behavior. 
</li>

<h2 id="RELEASENOTES">Release Notes</h2><div>
<ul>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.5</b> (Oct 30, 2018): 
<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.1. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
      The Update includes an accelerated MathParser, improved persistence 
      in combination with sequencers and a fix where values were available 
      even though the corresponding feature was not. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's File Access is now supported. See the new parameters 
      'fileaccess_file_path', 'fileaccess_remote_name', 
      'do_fileaccess_download', 'do_fileaccess_upload', 
      'do_fileaccess_delete', and the new HDevelop example 
      genicamtl_fileaccess.hdev. 
</li>
<li>GenICam's FWUpdate is now supported. See 
      <a href="#FW_UPDATE">Firmware Update</a> and the new HDevelop example 
      genicamtl_fwupdate.hdev. 
</li>
<li>Receiving GenICam events on message queues is now supported, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_MESSAGE_QUEUES">Event Message Queues</a>. 
      So far, GenICam events were only supported via callbacks and thus 
      not usable in HDevelop. Additionally, two new HDevelop examples have been 
      added to show this functionality genicamtl_acquisition_events.hdev 
      and genicamtl_devicelost_event.hdev. 
</li>
<li>'do_write_configuration' has been extended to store not only the 
      current device configuration but also generate persistence files 
      for all the GenTL Producer modules 
      (system, interface, device and data stream), see 
      <a href="#PARAMETER_PERSISTENCE">Parameters &ndash; Persisting Device Status</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters 'buffer_timestamp_ns' and 
      'device_timestamp_frequency' to improve the usability of 
      'buffer_timestamp' which on its own is unit-agnostic. 
</li>
<li>If a GenTL Producer did not implement an immediate stop of the 
      acquisition engine (ACQ_STOP_FLAGS_KILL), stopping the engine (e.g. 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/close_framegrabber.html">close_framegrabber</a>) could lead to a deadlock. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>On Windows, GenTL Producers that required additional dependencies which 
      were on the same location but not in PATH were not loaded correctly. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>On aarch64-linux, GenTL Producers were searched in GENICAM_GENTL32_PATH 
      instead of GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Some generic parameters passed to <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> were not available 
      through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>String parameters longer than 1024 characters were silently cropped by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When 'start_async_after_grab_async' was set 'disable', 
      the acquisition was stopped on the remote device after each frame. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>For consistency, the following examples have been renamed: 
      genicamtl_areascan3d_objectmodel3d.hdev to 
      genicamtl_vrmagic_areascan3d_objectmodel3d.hdev, 
      genicamtl_gocator_objectmodel3d.hdev to 
      genicamtl_lmi_gocator_objectmodel3d.hdev, and 
      genicamtl_smartray_3dsensor_objectmodel3d.hdev to 
      genicamtl_smartray_ecco_objectmodel3d.hdev. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.4</b> (Apr 27, 2018): 

<ul>
<li>Added support for the 'Mono4p' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'YCbCr411_8' pixel format. 
</li>
<li>Unsupported pixel formats are now tried to be returned in their actual 
      image dimensions if they are similar enough to a supported Mono format. 
      Before, all unsupported formats were returned as square images (see 
      <a href="#RAW_OUTPUT">Raw Output Format</a>). 
</li>
<li>On Unix systems, HALCON crashed when ended without calling 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/close_framegrabber.html">close_framegrabber</a>. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When 'DeviceUserID' was set to ' ' (a single space), it could not be 
      used to connect.  This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>When trying to connect to a busy device using its DeviceUserID, 
      a misleading low-level error appeared. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.3</b> (Nov 28, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>The technical dependency from the HALCON Library has been removed. 
</li>
<li>Added support of GenTL module events. They are used just as the device 
      events but including the module's square bracket prefix. So you can 
      query the available module events by querying 'EventSelector_values' 
      prefixed according to the desired module. For further information, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameter 'event_notification_helper' which enables a helper 
      to automatically set 'EventNotification' during 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/set_framegrabber_callback.html">set_framegrabber_callback</a> if the callback is being registered on an 
      SFNC-compliant event. For further information, see 
      <a href="#EVENT_DATA">Event Data</a>. 
</li>
<li>Added new parameters 'buffer_frameid' and 'image_pixel_format'. 
</li>
<li>Confidence data coming as Non-Multi-Part was assigned a wrong image 
      content. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The unit of generated 3D object model coordinates was kilometer. 
      This problem has been fixed. Now, the unit is meter. 
</li>
<li>When calling <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_callback.html">get_framegrabber_callback</a> on a callback that was not 
      registered, an error was returned. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>With some cameras, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> did not start a new acquisition in 
      'SingleFrame' or 'MultiFrame' mode even though 
      'start_async_after_grab_async' was enabled. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>An HDevelop example has been added demonstrating acquiring images 
      and a HALCON ObjectModel3D from a SmartRay 3D sensor. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.2</b> (May 3, 2017): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0.2 
      which contains some minor bug fixes. 
</li>
<li>Devices that do not provide the 'AcquisitionStart' and 'AcquisitionStop' 
      commands were not supported. This problem has been fixed. Now, 
      they can be used by setting the Generic parameter of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> 
      to 'workarounds=tolerate_missing_acquisition_control_features'. 
      For Camera Link devices, this workaround is automatically switched on. 
</li>
<li>An HDevelop example has been added demonstrating acquiring images 
      and a HALCON ObjectModel3D from a Basler TOF sensor. 
</li>
<li>The interface documentation was extended and now contains 
      a description of the strings returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...,'info_boards',...)</tt>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 13.0.1</b> (Oct 28, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>HALCON 13 version of the interface. 
</li>
<li>Added support for GenTL 1.5. This mainly means support for 3D data 
      acquisition, see <a href="#USING_3D">Using 3D Devices</a>.<br> 
      Therefore, the operators <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>/<a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a> have been implemented, 
      see <a href="#ACQUISITION_OPERATORS">Acquisition &ndash; Grab Operators</a>.<br> 
      To control the 3D data acquisition, the following parameters have been 
      introduced: image_contents, image_source_id, image_region_id, 
      image_purpose_id, image_raw_buffer_type, image_raw_buffer_padding_bytes, 
      data_contents, data_source_id, data_region_id, data_purpose_id, 
      create_objectmodel3d, coordinate_transform_mode, confidence_mode, 
      confidence_threshold, add_objectmodel3d_overlay_attrib. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.5</b> (May 13, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0.1. 
      With the previous version some specific cameras could not be opened 
      and in the worst case the application also crashed when using such 
      devices. This problem has been fixed. Please note that therefore also 
      the genicam directory of your HALCON installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Under Windows, <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> crashed if the environment variable 
      <tt>PATH</tt> was empty. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Improved support for linescan cameras by querying the delivered image 
      height for buffers first (if it is available). This also enables the 
      use of producers for linescan cameras which do not properly update the 
      buffer height. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.4</b> (Feb 15, 2016): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v3.0, 
      which enables to open a device much faster and requires less memory. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Added support for the 'Mono10p' and 'Mono12p' pixel formats. 
</li>
<li>Added paragraph 'Using internal color conversion' to this document. 
</li>
<li>According to this documentation, the fourth value returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a><tt>(..., 'AnyParameter_range', ...)</tt> 
      was a default value. Actually, it is the current value. 
      Thus, this documentation has been adapted accordingly. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.3</b> (Oct 30, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>The system requirements regarding the Visual Studio C++ 
      Redistributable Package have been updated. 
</li>
<li>The error code H_ERR_FGABORTED (#5336) is returned by the grab 
      operators when a grab has been aborted instead of the former H_ERR_FGF 
      (#5306). 
</li>
<li>In case of devices which do not allow to stop acquisition, e.g. due 
      to a lost connection, the call of the parameter 'do_abort_grab' was 
      not able to abort the running grab. This problem has been fixed. 
      Please note that in this case the communication with the device is 
      somehow broken and re-initialization is strongly advised. 
</li>
<li>Added support for user-defined names. 
      Therefore, the strings returned by 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'info_boards'...)</tt> and 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(...'device'...)</tt> have been extended 
      to include the new entries 
      unique_name:&lt;unique name&gt; and 
      user_name:&lt;user-defined name&gt; which corresponds to UserDeviceID. 
      The content of the new unique_name entry 
      is the same as the content of the former device entry. 
      Now, the device entry contains the user-defined name if available 
      or the unique name. 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> now also accepts user-defined names. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.2</b> (Jun 10, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>Under Windows, some GenICam dynamic libraries were not loaded/unloaded 
      correctly and a low-level error was printed. This problem has been 
      fixed. 
</li>
<li>do_abort_grab returned an error if called before the first grab. 
      This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>For 'na' (not available) parameters, neither the range nor the 
      values property was implemented. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>Parameters 'grab_timeout' and 'delay_after_stop' were missing the range 
      property. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The access and visibility properties returned 'undefined' in case 
      the parameters had no such properties. Now they return an error 
      if they are not available. 
</li>
<li>'available_param_names' returned not all implemented parameters. Now it 
      also returns 'na' (not available) parameters in addition to 'ro' 
      (readonly), 'wo' (writeonly) and 'rw' (readwrite) parameters, but only 
      when the visibility is not 'invisible'. Note that the access mode of 
      parameters might change during runtime. 
</li>
<li>The documentation of 'num_buffers' was not clear enough about the 
      need of an extra buffer for internal use. The documentation has been 
      improved. 
</li>
<li>Parameters 'buffer_is_incomplete', 'buffer_timestamp', 
      'raw_buffer_padding_bytes', 'raw_buffer_type' had fixed access mode 
      'ro'.  In case no buffer has been grabbed yet this is wrong and should 
      be 'na'. This problem has been fixed. 
</li>
<li>The HDevelop example genicamtl_parameters.hdev 
      has been improved. 
</li>
<li>The HDevelop example genicamtl_gocator_objectmodel3d.hdev 
      has been adapted to Gocator GenTL Driver version 4.x. 
      Now X-Y-Z offset and X-Y-Z resolution are in nanometer. 
      Moreover the TransformationZOffset is now correctly interpreted. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 6.1</b> (Feb 26, 2015): 

<ul>
<li>Updated underlying GenApi version to latest official release v2.4.1, 
      including performance improvements and several minor bug fixes. 
      Please note that therefore also the genicam directory of your HALCON 
      installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Aligned consumer with GenTL v1.4 specification. 
</li>
<li>Added support for buffer handling modes 'OldestFirstOverwrite' 
      and 'NewestOnly', this needs to be supported by the producer. 
</li>
<li>Added generic parameter 'device_event_handling=0' to explicitly 
      ignore the event channel when a device is opened. 
</li>
<li>Made warning about unexpected parameter types more human readable. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.8</b> (Mar 20, 2014): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem when using multiple image acquisition interfaces, which 
      do not use the same GenApi version, in arbitrary order. 
</li>
<li>Fixed crash when using multiple GenApi-based image acquisition 
      interfaces which use the same GenApi version. In this case, when 
      closing the last instance of one of the interfaces, GenApi could not 
      be used by the remaining interfaces anymore. This fix has the side 
      effect that GenApi cannot be unloaded anymore. 
</li>
<li>Improved description of parameter 'clear_buffer'. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.7</b> (Jan 31, 2014): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when trying to execute GenICam commands without parameter. 
</li>
<li>Fixed crash when trying to use volatile mode. 
</li>
<li>Improved robustness by guarding more calls with exception handling. 
</li>
<li>Added support for PFNC pixel format namespace. Please note that 
      no additional conversion routines have been implemented. 
</li>
<li>New parameter 'register_&lt;addr&gt;_&lt;len&gt;' for direct register 
      access. 
</li>
<li>Added parameters 'do_write_settings' and 'do_load_settings' to write 
      and load GenICam persistence settings. The parameters 
      'do_write_configuration' and 'do_load_configuration' also support 
      GenICam persistence now. 
</li>
<li>Switching of 'color_space' parameter values now has immediate effect. 
</li>
<li>Extended documentation of 'streaming_mode' and 'clear_buffer' parameters. 
</li>
<li>Renamed environment variables:<br> 
      <tt> 
      HALCON_GENTL_WRITE_XMLFILE -> HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_XMLFILE<br> 
      HALCON_GENTL_WRITE_RAW_XMLFILE -> HALCON_GENICAM_WRITE_RAW_XMLFILE<br> 
      HALCON_GENTL_FILE_PAYLOAD_DIR -> HALCON_ACQUIRED_FILE_PAYLOAD_DIR 
      </tt> 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.6</b> (May 24, 2013): 

<ul>
<li>The generic parameter 'streaming_mode=0' can now be used with devices 
      which do not provide AcquisitionStart/Stop/Mode features. 
</li>
<li>The internal event handling is now more robust regarding a potential 
      race condition when killing events. 
</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a>(..., 'info_boards', ...) or 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a>(..., 'device', ...) is called and no device is 
      detected. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.5</b> (Mar 25, 2013): 

<ul>
<li>Completely revised the entire interface implementation. Note that 
      backward compatibility is not fully maintained in all cases, in 
      particular some of the parameters are no more supported. 
</li>
<li>Improved producer and device detection and added more flexible device 
      opening options. 
</li>
<li>Supports parallel open connections to devices from same and/or 
      different GenTL producers. 
</li>
<li>Extensive GenICam support including advanced features and parameter 
      types like IRegister. GenICam 64 Bit integers are now supported also 
      on 32 Bit systems. 
</li>
<li>Support of GenICam chunk data through <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/get_framegrabber_param.html">get_framegrabber_param</a>, removed 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a>(_async) which provided limited support for chunks in the 
      past. The new implementation keeps the grabbed buffer at runtime until 
      the next grab. 
</li>
<li>Support of GenICam events and GenICam event data through callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Support of GenICam feature change notifications through callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Added 'do_write_configuration' parameter. 
</li>
<li>Removed 'callback_timeout' parameter. 
</li>
<li>Support of devices changing basic image properties at runtime 
      as well as GenTL producers modifying the image. 
</li>
<li>Support of non-image payload types. 
</li>
<li>Improved support of unknown image formats as raw data. 
</li>
<li>Improved support for reading and writing of GenICam configuration (XML) 
      files. 
</li>
<li>Support of devices with known problems with callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Adapted documentation. 
</li>
<li>Improved LMI Gocator example 
      genicamtl_gocator_objectmodel3d.hdev. Now the Z coordinate 
      is correctly converted to the HALCON camera coordinate system and the 
      example shows how to load a configuration file. 
</li>
<li>Fixed documentation of the 'generic' parameter. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.4</b> (Nov 16, 2012): 

<ul>
<li>Removed all dependencies on HALCONROOT environment variable. 
</li>
<li>Fixed XML loading so devices can be opened even when no manifest is 
      available. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.3</b> (Oct 22, 2012): 

<ul>
<li>Use XML with highest schema and version number from manifest. 
</li>
<li>Fixed handling of CLProtocol URLs. 
</li>
<li>Fixed wrong data size for some DSInfo calls to producer. 
</li>
<li>Fixed cancel_mutex locking in case of errors. 
</li>
<li>Removed warning messages while registering internal GenApi callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Added new example genicamtl_gocator_objectmodel3d.hdev for 
      the usage of the LMI Gocator calibrated 3D sensor. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.2</b> (Sep 28, 2012): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which can lead to a crash when opening some devices while 
      parsing parameters. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.1</b> (July 11, 2012): 

<ul>
<li>Updated GenApi to v2.3.1. Please note that therefore also the genicam 
      directory of your HALCON installation will be updated. 
</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the automatic update of the parameters Width, 
      Height, PayloadSize and AcquisitionMode due to incorrect handling of 
      internal GenApi callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Added HDevelop example program for the usage of the VRmagic AreaScan3D 
      calibrated 3D area sensor. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 5.0</b> (May 15, 2012): 

<ul>
<li>HALCON 11 version of the interface (included in HALCON 11 DVD). 
</li>
<li>Added support for multiple producers at once. 
</li>
<li>Added caching for access mode of ports. 
</li>
<li>Fixed URL parsing. 
</li>
<li>Added missing error checks but also relaxed too strict checks. 
</li>
<li>Added more warning messages and revised texts. 
</li>
<li>Relaxed GenApi callback registration code. 
</li>
<li>Added support for Mac OS X 10.7. 
</li>
<li>Use of GenApi v2.3. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 4.4</b> (Nov 21, 2011): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed wrong return value in parameter 'buffer_timestamp' and changed 
      type from integer to string. 
</li>
<li>Fixed adding GenICam path to PATH environment variable each time 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> was called. 
</li>
<li>Fixed problem when using more than one device with the same name, but 
      different interfaces. 
</li>
<li>Fixed problem with starting the stream each time <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a> or 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image_async.html">grab_image_async</a> was called. 
</li>
<li>Added support of chunk data via the operators <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data.html">grab_data</a> and 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_data_async.html">grab_data_async</a>. Also in this document a section has been added. 
</li>
<li>Added functionality to get notified in case of any available 
      device-specific event via user-specific callbacks. 
</li>
<li>Added mutex protection for grabbing images. 
</li>
<li>Added parameters 'available_callback_types' and 'callback_timeout'. 
</li>
<li>Added parameters 'clear_buffer' and 'verify_value'. 
</li>
<li>Added generic parameters 'device_access' and 'streaming_mode'. 
</li>
<li>Changed <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(..'general'..)</tt> to static list. 
</li>
<li>Changed behavior of <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/grab_image.html">grab_image</a> if AcquisitionMode of the 
      device is 'Continuous'. Now always a new image should be returned. 
</li>
<li>Changed behavior of parameter 'do_write_xml_file'. Now not only 
      the XML file of the remote device but also the XML files of the 
      GenTL Producer's modules are written (including the name of the 
      used GenTL Producer). 
</li>
<li>Changed internal color conversion to rely on the information which 
      is provided by the current buffer. Currently, the interface uses 
      the PixelFormat of the device, if the BUFFER_INFO_PIXELFORMAT_NAMESPACE 
      or the BUFFER_INFO_PIXELFORMAT returns unsupported values. In this 
      case a low-level error message will be returned. 
</li>
<li>Removed setting of external trigger from <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a>. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 4.3</b> (Dec 13, 2010): 

<ul>
<li>Changed default setting for horizontal/vertical resolution 
      in <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/open_framegrabber.html">open_framegrabber</a> from 1 to 0. 
</li>
<li>Fixed parsing problems of the XML files under Linux, when opening a 
      camera several times. 
</li>
<li>Fixed timeout when the image size has been changed and software trigger 
      is used. 
</li>
<li>Fixed problem with setting module parameters, which in some cases led 
      to an error. 
</li>
<li>Fixed error if more than one GenTL Producer was found, but one of them 
      could not be loaded. Now the broken one is skipped and all others 
      can be loaded correctly. 
</li>
<li>Improved color conversion for YUV pixel formats. 
</li>
<li>Added support of representation tags to show hexadecimal numbers 
      correctly. 
</li>
<li>Added low-level error messages to improve error handling. 
</li>
<li>Added helper function to correct a value which exceeds the valid 
      boundaries of a parameter. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 4.2</b> (Sep 30, 2010): 

<ul>
<li>Changed order of starting the acquisition: Now the acquisition of the 
      remote device is started after starting the acquisition of the GenTL 
      Producer. 
</li>
<li>Fixed error when calling <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a> with parameters 
      'info_boards', 'device' or 'general' more than once after each other. 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 4.1</b> (Sep 10, 2010): 

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug to prevent HDevelop crash if 
      <a class="halconoperator" href="../operators/info_framegrabber.html">info_framegrabber</a><tt>(..., 'info_boards', ...)</tt> was called 
      while a device was already open. 
</li>
<li>Fixed bug to prevent double calls of 'StartAcquisition' which 
      led to problems with some devices. 
</li>
<li>Enabled use of multiple devices simultaneously. 
</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak. 
</li>
<li>Fixed bug to enable opening a device even if there exist no module 
      parameters in the used GenTL Producer. 
</li>
<li>Module parameter names now start with the prefix of the corresponding 
      module layer to ensure the uniqueness of all parameter names. Without 
      the prefix the returned values and categories of these parameters 
      could have been wrong. 
</li>
<li>If the environment variables for GenICam were not set correctly, 
      the interface failed with H_ERR_DLOPEN. Now the delayed loading 
      of the GenICam libraries is enabled, so that the environment 
      variables can be set automatically. 
</li>
<li>Added parameters 'buffer_is_incomplete', 'buffer_timestamp', 
      'do_write_xml_file', 'num_buffers_await_delivery', 
      'num_buffers_underrun', 'tl_displayname', 'tl_filename', tl_id', 
      'tl_model', and 'tl_pathname'. 
</li>
<li>Added paragraphs 'GenICam GenTL' and 'Parameter Naming' in 
      this documentation. 
</li>
<li>HALCON 10 version of the interface (included in HALCON 10 DVD). 
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Revision 4.0</b> (Jul 30, 2010): 

<ul>
<li>First official release.
